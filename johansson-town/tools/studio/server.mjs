const server=new McpServer({name:'johansson-studio',version:'1.6.0'},{instructions:'Johansson Studio: the town\'s characters, and Sakura Shōten\'s products and their labels. Look first (character_list, character_get, render_portrait; product_list, product_get, render_product), then change with a dry run, show the creator (a baked label comes back as a picture), and apply with dryRun:false only when they agree: that puts the change in Studio\'s draft, outside git. World changes only when the creator says "update World" (publish_draft, the guide portraits and runtime build, publish_check, then commit, merge main, push, check the live workflow). Assets from Make model: asset_list, asset_export (the iPad\'s files, drawn headless), asset_draft (a package the creator sent; dry run first), asset_publish only on "update World". Static GLBs: model_inspect checks dimensions and possible surface overlaps; model_snap computes a grid or connector transform; model_prepare exports an adjusted copy (dry run first). These use the UI workshop and never change or publish town placements. Room drafts: room_create/open/get/edit/import_model/export/check/render share the Edit room document and commands. Use expectedRevision and dry runs; exchange .room.json files explicitly. Generic room drafts do not publish World. Native workshop: world_room_open/check/publish/rollback preserves machinery and checks contact, collisions, doorway, staff paths and prompts. world_room_publish requires both revisions, a dry run, and the creator’s update-World instruction; it writes only local data and its generated module. Build, review and deploy explicitly. Allow floating marks an intentional support exception, never a collision bypass. World library: world_asset_list/get/review/review_export exposes purpose and reference evidence; review proposals never remove World geometry. room_drop and room_check add static support queries. Films reuse the EXISTING jojo/remotion engine: film_pipeline_info describes it; scene_export_film exports actual World plate/camera/cast staging, not an approved episode. No second renderer. Setup: avatar-creator/docs/MODEL-WORKSHOP.md, ROOM-PROJECTS.md, WORLD-LIBRARY.md, WORKSHOP-ROUNDTRIP.md and REMOTION-PLAN.md.'});
