# The Minato Maru: status of the vessel and engine particulars

**Revision B reference + C1 fuel addendum — for design review; construction not approved.** C1 fuel-only issue 2026-10-17; immutable Revision B issued 2026-10-13. Generated from the ship's data by `node tools/ferry-status.mjs`
(`tests/ferry-status.test.mjs` fails when this report no longer matches the data), so the numbers here are the ones the game, the
drawings and the plant run on. Sources: `src/world/ferry-ship.js` (particulars, machinery, electrics, loads, safety), `ferry-model.js`
(the loft), `ferry-interior.js` (the machinery spaces as built), `ferry-piping.js`, `ferry-electrical.js`, `ferry-plant.js`,
`johansson-marine.js` (the fictional makers' catalogue). The reviewed CAD and construction work register are linked from `cad-revb/index.html`. The yard's findings and historical programme are in `README.md`; the batches in `../FERRY-AUDIT.md`.

## 1. The vessel

| | |
|---|---|
| Name, port of registry | Minato Maru (みなと丸), Minato |
| Owner | Minato-chō (the town ferry, a chōei ferī) |
| Type | Passenger ship and vehicle ferry (ryokakusen ken jidōsha tosen), bow ramp only, twin screw |
| Built, refit | 1994, Johansson Shipyard (ヨハンソン造船), Innoshima, Seto Inland Sea: hull No. 127, an island ferry like the dozens before her; 1998: GMDSS (VHF with DSC, EPIRB, SART, NAVTEX) |
| Rules, area | Fictional narrative reference to Japanese inspection and NK class; no actual flag, class or construction approval has been obtained; Limited coastal (gentei engan) |
| Length overall / between perpendiculars | 34.5 m / 31 m |
| Breadth moulded / depth to car deck | 8.4 m / 3 m |
| Draft laden / service; freeboard laden | 1.9 m / 1.7 m; 1.1 m |
| Gross tonnage | 199 |
| Geometric displacement at the design immersion | 375.41053 t; numerical loft in seawater, not a verified loading condition |
| Legacy lightship / operating target / payload target | 210 t / 283 t / 73 t; unreconciled assumptions. 165.41053 t is an arithmetic residual, not approved deadweight. |
| Block coefficient / game-motion GM | 0.74026634 on LBP 31 m; 1.6 m motion parameter only, stability unverified |
| Passengers / vehicles / crew | 100 / 6 cars (or a truck and 2 cars, or 8 kei trucks; 5 t axle, 4.2 m clear) / 8 |
| Speed service / trial / manoeuvring / inside the breakwater | 11.5 / 12.8 / 3 / 5 kn |
| Colours | White superstructure; white hull over red-brown antifouling with a teal sheer band (the ferry company’s colour on the Port Building); teal funnels with the town’s anchor mark |

### 1.1 The hull as lofted against the particulars (README finding 1: still open)

| | Particulars | From the loft at 1.9 m |
|---|---|---|
| Displacement | 375.41053 t geometric | 375.4 t |
| Block coefficient on LBP 31 m | 0.74026634 | 0.74026634 |
| Block coefficient on LOA 34.5 m | Separate length basis | 0.66516686 |
| Waterplane area | — | 259.28 m² |
| LCB from the transom | — | 19.3 m |
| KB / BM_T / KM_T | — | 1.06 / 3.89 / 4.95 m |
| TPC | — | 2.66 t/cm |

The geometric particulars now match the numerical loft at the stated immersion and density 1.025 t/m³. The legacy weight targets remain unreconciled. Weight groups, loading cases, KG, free-surface corrections and intact/damage stability must establish a real operating condition before any hull revision or construction release.

### 1.2 General arrangement

## 2. Engine and machinery particulars

Every machine is a Johansson Marine machine (CLAUDE.md: Johansson is this universe's Acme), built like the real marine machines of its day; its model number is in the catalogue and its numbers are the ship's own.

## 3. Electrical particulars

| | |
|---|---|
| System | 440 V three-phase three-wire, insulated from earth (earth lamps and an insulation meter on the board); lighting 105 V through 2 × 30 kVA (1 in use) |
| Generators | 2 × JG-125 125 kVA (100 kW, pf 0.8) 445 V 60 Hz 1800 rpm, 162 A; breaker 200 A frame set 170 A; trips: over-current, short-time, under-voltage and reverse power (about 10 %) |
| Emergency generator | JG-40E 40 kVA (32 kW), on load within 45 s as a game assumption; 60 L day tank with assumed 15 h endurance, unverified; Provisional continuous capacity only. Emergency fire-pump starting and voltage recovery require generator/AVR/governor transient validation; current comparison alone does not prove performance. |
| Batteries | 24 V, banks: starting, radio and emergency; transitional 30 min |
| Shore supply | 200 V 3-phase 60 Hz, 50 kVA (40 kW), 50 kVA 200/440 V in the quay kiosk at Minato; primary 200 V breaker 160 A frame / 145 A setting; secondary 440 V 80 A frame / 66 A setting; Shore power and the generators never run together: the shore breaker and the generators’ breakers are interlocked |
| Switchboards | MSB: Main switchboard, in the engine control booth: DG1, synchronising (synchroscope, lamps, two kW meters, Hz, V, A, three earth lamps, insulation meter), DG2, two 440 V feeder panels, shore; LB: 105 V lighting board, fed through one of the two 30 kVA transformers; ESB: Emergency switchboard, 440 V and 105 V sections, in the emergency-generator room: fed from the main board through a bus-tie, and from the emergency generator when the main board is dead |
| Consumers | 51 loads in the load analysis (sheet 3a), 59 feeders with breakers and cables (sheets 3b, 3c) |

### 3.1 Load by condition (sheet 3a)

| Condition | Supply | Demand | Load |
|---|---|---|---|
| sea | 1 generator 100 kW | 40.2 kW | 40 % |
| arrival | 2 generators 200 kW | 110.1 kW | 55 % |
| loading | 1 generator 100 kW | 46 kW | 46 % |
| night | shore 40 kW | 11 kW | 27 % |
| blackout | emergency generator 32 kW | 10 kW | 31 % |

Source numerical consistency checks (`electricalChecks()`): zero mismatches in the implemented checks. Fault levels, selectivity, starting and installation engineering holds remain open.

## 4. Piping systems (sheets 8.1–8.11) and route status

| System | Nodes | Lines | Duty / standby pairs |
|---|---|---|---|
| fuel | 18 | 22 | Fuel transfer: tp1 / tp2 |
| lube | 28 | 28 | Lubricating oil, port main engine: lop-mainP / prime-mainP; Lubricating oil, starboard main engine: lop-mainS / prime-mainS |
| seawater | 20 | 23 | Sea-water cooling, port main engine: swp-mainP / gs; Sea-water cooling, starboard main engine: swp-mainS / gs |
| jacket | 24 | 24 | — |
| bilge | 21 | 24 | Bilge: bp / fbp; Ballast: balp / gs2 |
| fire | 22 | 22 | Fire main: fp1 / fp2 |
| air | 16 | 17 | Starting air: c1 / c2 |
| freshwater | 11 | 15 | Fresh water: hp1 / hp2 |
| sewage | 9 | 10 | Sanitary flushing: sp1 / sp2; Sewage discharge: dp1 / dp2 |
| exhaust | 14 | 8 | — |
| hydraulics | 13 | 17 | Steering: hpu1 / hpu2; Ramp: rp1 / rp2 |

The graph contains 210 lines and 151 machinery-space anchors. There are 67 accepted engineering routes and 139 unresolved positive-bore connections. The 172 coloured game preview runs are illustrative and unverified; graph connectivity alone does not prove physical pipe routing. Every pumped service has two means in the source (14 pairs), with hydraulic capacity and installation verification still open. C1 rechecks 22 fuel external connections with separate proposed ports, access reservations and retained non-fuel services; 0 fuel geometric issues remain. See [the C1 fuel-only addendum](fuel-c1/README.md). All C1 interfaces, internal manifold assemblies, tank partitions, hydraulic sizing, fittings and unvalidated services remain design holds; geometry-clear is not installation approval.

## 5. Life-saving and fire safety (sheet 6)

108 persons; 5 liferafts × 25 (serviced yearly in Naha); rescue boat 4 m for 6 with a 15 hp outboard and a 3.7 kW davit; extinguishers, hydrants, the CO₂ system, muster stations and escapes on the fire control and safety plan.

Readings at 14:00: board 1 generator(s) on the board, 16 kW; starting air 26 / 25 bar; service tank 48 %; fresh-water pressure 0.31 MPa; alarms: none. The player works the plant at 20 stations (start, stop, standby, isolate and tag out, open for overhaul, breakers, change-overs); the console's dials, readout and alarm matrix read the plant.

## 7. The design programme: built and open

### Built

| Batch | Sheets | What |
|---|---|---|
| D1 (built 2026-10-12) | 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 3a, 4 | The generator, the lines, hydrostatics, GA, one-line, loads, tanks; finding 1 |
| D9 (built 2026-10-12) | 5, 6 | Engine room arrangement from the interior as built, with the equipment list; the fire control and safety plan, posted aboard |
| D9a (built 2026-10-12) | all | Every sheet framed as a yard drawing: border with zones, title block (yard, ship, drawing number JS-127-nn, scale, sheet, date, drawn/checked/approved, revision), wrapped notes, labels that fit, dimension lines, hatched sections (the creator, 2026-10-12: "The drawings don't look real and text overflowing") |
| D14 (6q-1, built 2026-10-13) | 7, 2, 4, 6 | The machinery spaces as a line of rooms on several levels (the creator, 2026-10-13: "The engine room should be several levels and have many rooms"): the auxiliary machinery room, the workshop and the engine store forward of the engine room through a watertight sliding door, walkable in the game with their machines, prompts and safety items; the ballast moved into the double bottom under them; finding 5 |
| D16 (6r-1, built 2026-10-13) | 5, 7 | The pipes built in 3D from the piping diagrams (the creator: "are pipes connected, do they lead to systems?"): every machine, tank stub and penetration of the machinery spaces anchored (`FERRY_INTERIOR.anchors`), every line between two of them routed as an orthogonal run in its system's colour and bore by `src/world/ferry-pipe-routes.js` (overhead lanes by system, bilge and oil mains under the plates, cross runs along the forward bulkheads, a machine's own circuit hugging it), drawn in the game and on the plans of sheets 5 and 7; 172 of 181 lines, the rest ending at a penetration to another deck; tested against the machines (`tests/ferry-pipes.test.mjs`) |
| D10 (built 2026-10-13) | 8.1–8.11 | Piping diagrams from `FERRY_PIPING` (the creator: "Make a piping diagram too, so all pipes are correct, and redundant motors so you can alternate"): eleven systems, 196 nodes and 210 lines with bores, every node tagged (KKS) and placed; every pumped service with two means (`FERRY_SERVICES`: duty and standby, alternated weekly): a second fuel transfer pump, compressor, hydrophore pump, sanitary pump and sewage pump added to the ship, the general-service pump standing by for either main engine's cooling and for the ballast, the fire and bilge pump for the bilge, the emergency fire pump outside the engine room; the engine-driven pumps' electric standbys. Open: the diagrams' pipe runs drawn in the engine room's model from the same data (the runs there are painted by system today) |
| D15 (built 2026-10-13) | 3, 3b, 3c | Electrical drawings from `FERRY_FEEDERS` (the creator: "electrical drawings for the ship … correct … with proper cabling"): the one-line with every source, board, transformer and feeder tagged; the feeder lists with full-load current, starter (star-delta over 7.5 kW), breaker (≥ 1.25 × FLA, standard ratings), marine cable by rating and by voltage drop (≤ 5 %) over its route, length and route; the cable schedule with KKS cable numbers. Open: control and alarm cabling (4501–5999), the motor starter schematics, the lighting circuits fixture by fixture |
| D17 (built 2026-10-13) | 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 6 | The car deck's working fittings, from the creator's photographs and films of a working road ferry (he chose to keep her white and teal and take the fittings only): `FERRY_DECK_FITTINGS` in `ferry-model.js`. The vehicle barrier, two red-and-white leaves 0.7 m aft of the bow houses, shut across the lanes at sea and lifted upright onto the walkways when the ramp is down (a wall in the walk either way); a lane-signal post on each bow house with a board each way (lane 2, the truck's centre lane, lane 1) under three lamps, red at sea, green with the ramp down, and the four 500 W ramp floodlights of the `floodlights` load, drawn at last and lit for loading after dark; the lane signals as a consumer of their own on the lighting board (`lane-signals`, 0.18 kW, 10BRB10 GS020, cable 10BRB10 1016); red walkways outboard of the lanes forward of the casings; the four car-deck hydrants of the fire main (hCar1–4) drawn as valves with handwheel and brass coupling, aft on the casings by the hose boxes and forward on the bulwark with hose boxes of their own, and the safety plan corrected to them (it had three, at places the piping did not have); stainless exhaust pipes out of the funnels; 非常口 and 前に物を置かないでください on the engine room's escape door (`FERRY_DECK_SIGNS`). Views 18–20 and n5 in `tools/ferry-look.mjs`. The fittings cost 1 810 triangles and five meshes after trimming (the lamps, lenses and boards merged): the model is at 39 meshes of its 40, so the next moving part must share a mesh |
| D18 (6r-2, built 2026-10-13) | — | The plant runs (`src/world/ferry-plant.js`): every engine and motor-driven machine with a state, the duty/standby pairs, a chief's interlocks, the crew's day by the clock; the console's dials and alarm matrix, the prompts at 18 stations and her sound read it (`ferry-plant-controls.js`); the player starts, stops, changes over, isolates and opens machines (`tests/ferry-plant-game.test.mjs`) |

### Open

| Batch | Sheets | What |
|---|---|---|
| D2 | weight estimate, 1b | Lightship by group and deadweight by condition in the data; draft, trim and KG by condition; the GM the ship really has |
| D3 | 1, 1a, 1b | The hull faired finer at the ends to the target block coefficient; the model follows; walked and photographed |
| D4 | 5 midship section, 5a scantlings | `FERRY_STRUCTURE`: frames, plating, stiffeners, deck loads, by rule; the section drawn |
| D5 | 6 shell expansion, 7 deck plans (structure) | Plates and seams, the car-deck grid of girders and pillars |
| D6 | 8 machinery arrangement, 9 piping | The engine room drawn to the data; one diagram per system |
| D7 | 10 fire-control and life-saving plans, 11 mooring | From `FERRY_SAFETY` and the mooring data |
| D8 | 12 stability booklet | Intact and damage stability, the loading conditions the master actually uses |
| D14b (6q-2) | 7 | The fan flat at 5.5 m over the lower lobby: the engine-room fans and their trunks down the casings, its ladder from the casing P landing and its hatch to the open deck; the `er-fans` load moves there |
| D14c (6q-3) | 5, 7 | The bilge level: the red tank top under the gratings, the bilge wells and their suctions, the sounding pipes, the shaft space seen through its manhole |
| D11 | 14 shafting and propeller | Shaft line, bearings, stern tube and seal, coupling, the propeller drawing (B-series section data), torsional check |
| D12 | 15 midship section, scantlings | Frames, plating, longitudinals, deck beams, pillars and bulkheads to a class rule (the ANYstructure DNV plate and girder tool is the reference), the lightship weight it gives feeding D2 |
| D13 | 16 ventilation, insulation, deck machinery | Engine-room air supply (the diesels' combustion air plus cooling), fire insulation classes, windlass and capstan foundations |

## 8. Open findings and what the CAD audit should settle

1. **The hull and weights** (finding 1): numerical loft displacement is recorded (§1.1), while lightship and operating weight remain assumptions. Weight groups and loading/stability cases (D2, D8) must establish draft, trim, KG and GM.
2. **No approved structure is drawn** (finding 2): midship scantlings (D12), shell expansion, deck plans (D5), machinery foundations and lifting structure need rule calculations and reviewed fabrication details. The CAD equipment envelopes are design references.
3. **Shafting and propeller** (D11), **ventilation, insulation and deck machinery** (D13), **the stability booklet** (D8) are open.
4. **The fan flat** (6q-2) and **the bilge level** (6q-3) of the machinery spaces are designed, not built; the CO₂ covers the engine room only (the new rooms rely on extinguishers and detection).
5. **The plant** (6r-3): overhaul scenes (covers off, parts on the plates) when a machine is opened, the crew at the handles when the routine starts a machine, alarm acknowledge, the plant saved with the game; the starboard engine's open No.4 crankcase door (from the photographs) should follow the plant's state.
6. **Lines beyond the machinery spaces** (hydrants on the car and passenger decks, the galley and toilets, the steering-gear room, the bow house) are on the diagrams but not yet built on their own decks.

Use the Revision B engineering review and construction work register for the full release holds, including supplier installation data, removal/escape paths, pipe classes and supports, electrical faults/selectivity/starting, flag/class basis and signed approval. Publication of the game and drawings does not close those holds.
