  headline:'The chief engineer who reads the island like a wiring diagram',
  standfirst:'Johansson keeps the Minato Maru’s machinery running, with a duty cabin aboard and his home with Thuan on Kitano-jima.',
  body:[
   'Johansson is chief engineer of the Minato Maru. His notebooks hold machinery readings, maintenance jobs and the small details that make a reliable crossing: the generators on at ten past six, the shore power at a quarter past ten, and everything in between. Mac Turner, the relief engineer, takes the watch whenever he is ashore; Tetsuo maintains the electrical equipment under contract and is watched near the switchboard like a hawk.',
   'He and Thuan live on Kitano-jima, across the water, and he has a duty cabin aboard for the nights the ship needs him. Lunch is often at Sato Ramen with the harbour’s other regulars. A broken radio still brings him to Chin and Tetsuo’s bench on a quiet afternoon, and an evening meal brings him to Minato, where his sister-in-law keeps his plate warm and tells him he works too late.',
   'He carries a second notebook that is not the ship’s. The harbour has one notebook; everything else, the island included, goes in this one.',

 Thuan:{
  headline:'Sakura’s owner knows what you need before you ask',

  body:[
   'Thuan came from Vietnam after her two elder sisters, with a notebook and a plan, and wrote every supplier’s name in it the first year. Now the shop, the accounts, the stock and the supply trade from the depot in the Quay Warehouse are hers, and she can tell the harbour cart from the bakery van by the sound of its wheels. The shelves are tea, rice, soap and batteries, but the regulars come for the way she sets a favourite aside before they ask. Since the florist on Rainflower Lane closed, the town’s flowers are hers too: island-grown stems in the buckets by the door, wrapped in brown paper at the till.',
   'Her name is on nearly every line of the staff roster in the back room. At the bottom, in her own hand, she has appointed an assistant manager: the potted palm. In the corner by the delivery door stands a figurine of her, a present from Johansson’s shipmates. She says it is too much. She dusts it every morning.',
   'She is the youngest of three sisters. Nhung, the eldest, is the island doctor and keeps Sakura’s counter on Sunday (the shop shuts on Saturday); Thao, the middle one, runs Minato. Lunch is in the park with both of them. Thuan comes over on the half past eight boat from Kitano-jima, where she lives with Johansson, opens at nine, pulls the shutter down at half past eight in the evening and takes the last boat home at ten. The plans for Sakura’s future are hers, and she will build them at her own pace.',

   'At four o’clock Thao hangs the noren and the evening begins: lanterns, the pink ¥10 telephone by the door, a laserdisc karaoke that takes its time finding the disc. Regulars keep their own bottles on the shelf behind the counter, each with a tag in Thao’s careful hand. Keep one yourself and she will warn you that being a regular is worse for you than it sounds.',
   'The regulars are the town. Mr Fujita comes in once the ship’s shore power is on and not a minute before; Mac has his one beer at half past seven and Officer Mori, passing on the night patrol, counts it. Nhung comes in with her sisters on Thuan’s Minato nights, Ren comes down from the ship for a late bowl, and Chin, her husband of twelve years, has won the last-Friday karaoke contest three times running. The police notice by the door asks drivers not to drink; Mori put it up himself and then sat under it with a beer. He walked home. Thao tells this story more often than Mori would like.',
   'Nobody lives at the bar. After last orders the cushions are stacked, Thao wipes the counter down and mops the floor herself, and walks home to 1 Kitahama, where Chin and their daughter Vy are asleep. She sleeps until late morning, buys for the izakaya at Sakura, has lunch in the park with her sisters and is back at her station to prep. The amber corner by the window is kept for unhurried conversations. She will not turn it into a hurried table, however full the room.',

  body:[
   'Her morning starts at the harbour, choosing fish for the stock while the auction is still shouting. By half past ten she is at the pots in her own kitchen, which she shares with nobody. Lunch runs from eleven to two, and the ticket machine sells your bowl if it is in the mood; when it is not, she takes the money over the counter. Miso ramen with butter and corn is the autumn bowl, ¥500.',
   'On the wall hang three autograph boards: a television presenter who came for the Hārī, the 1996 Seagulls squad, and Kayoko Shima, who sang at the harbour hall, ate two bowls and left a tip folded into a crane. At noon Mrs Sato carries two bowls in the aluminium okamochi to the harbour office, very fast and very level. She delivers to the harbour only. Anywhere else, she says, they can walk.',
   'Officer Mori has the same shoyu ramen at one o’clock every day of the year; she would like him to try the miso once. Nhung, the doctor, is not allowed to pay either; when surgery runs late Mrs Sato sends the bowl over. Jun, the ferry’s cook, says her stock recipe is his, which it is not. In the evenings she and Thao fight for the same crowd, ramen against the izakaya; they fall out, and make up over a delivery. On Wednesdays the shop is shut so she can make the week’s stock. She notices who has eaten and who has only said so.',

  standfirst:'Morning surgery at nine, house calls in the afternoon, and in the evening the town’s small paper coming off the bench at the back of the old Front-Row shop: Nhung is Minato’s doctor.',
  body:[
   'Surgery is at nine, in the clinic at the town hall, and the town comes in with its blood pressure, its backs and its opinions. Nhung knows that Grandmother Higa will ignore her advice and that Mr Fujita will not rest his back, and writes it all down anyway, in the same pencil she once used for slips in other people’s books. House calls are in the afternoon, in the little car in bay 2 of the Kitahama parking, with the bag. On Saturday the clinic shuts at noon; on Sunday she keeps Sakura’s counter while Thuan stays on Kitano-jima.',
   'The books went to Sakura when she took the clinic, but the paper did not. In the evening she sets it at the printing bench at the back of the old Front-Row shop: the ferry timetable, the tide table, the typhoon map and whatever Officer Mori’s three-page reports contain, which is mostly his lunch. The reading copies stayed on the shelves, with her slips still in them, and Tama the shop cat stayed with them; he has refused, on principle and permanently, to wear the tiny apron she once made him.',
   'The eldest of three sisters, she still checks that Thao has eaten and that Thuan has slept, now with a stethoscope to back her up. Home is 3 Kitahama, with her husband Kōji, who comes in smelling of the auction, and their son Riku, who is not allowed to borrow the stethoscope.

 Chin:{

  body:[
   'Chin signs on aboard the Minato Maru at five past six and tends her diesels, bilges and lubricating oil under the chief until the shore power goes on at night. He took the engine-room rating post when it came free, and he lines up his tools before he touches anything, aboard or ashore. Ask him to mend a radio and it may come back with a better aerial, a louder speaker and a screw left over, which Tetsuo will find and hold up in silence.',
   'He and Tetsuo have shared the workshop since school, and their argument about volume has no closing time. Tetsuo keeps the bench while the ship sails; Chin has it in the evenings and between watches, and the sabani hauled out in the Nishi yard are his to mend now. Johansson stops by on a quiet afternoon; the harbour office’s equipment is in their hands more often than the harbour master admits.',
   'On the last Friday of every month he becomes another person entirely: Minato’s karaoke champion, three titles in a row. The prize is a bottle on Thao’s keep shelf with his name on it. He has not opened any of them. Thao, his wife of twelve years, keeps them dusted, and their daughter Vy keeps count. Jun, the ship’s cook, keeps count of his second helpings.',

   'Tetsuo turns a tuning knob as though the radio might answer back, and on a good day it does. Old valve sets, ship receivers, the counter radio at Minato: he handles them gently, and he will not be rushed. His mother was a Chinen, from the old house on Kitano-jima, and the gentleness is hers.',
   'Chin has repaired Tetsuo’s own radio twice. Tetsuo keeps finding extra screws. Their disagreement about volume began at the workbench when they were at school together, and it has never been settled. After lunch he crosses to the Minato Maru, where he is the ferry’s electrician under contract, and Mac guards the switchboard from him like a hawk. The power house’s switchboard is his too, since it lost its keeper: two diesels, one running, one resting, and the logbook on the clipboard by the door.',
   'At six he goes to Umi-no-yu to tend the boiler and the pumps, and stays to close up. He takes his time over the gauges. Grandmother Higa sends him in past the bandai; he does not complain. A clear broadcast after a difficult repair is, he says, the best sound on the island, though the boiler running sweet comes close. Home is 2 Front-Row Yard, behind the bookshop, with the yard to himself.',

   'Mori takes the ordinary safety of the streets seriously. The desk at the police station is his from four in the afternoon until ten, with the lost property tagged in his careful handwriting and a thermos of barley tea for anybody who comes in upset. Then the night patrol, slow and exact: Main Street, the seawall, the lanes behind the shops, a stop at Minato to count Mac’s one beer, a look in on an elderly neighbour. He wants the streets to feel safe without feeling watched.',
   'His reports are three pages long and supply Nhung’s town paper with more detail than incident; she wants his stories, and he wants her to print fewer of them. The cat outside Sakura declines to acknowledge his authority, a long-running difficulty he records conscientiously. Lunch is the same shoyu ramen at Sato Ramen at one o’clock, every day of the year.',
   'The drink-driving notice at Minato is his. He put it up himself and then, off duty, sat under it with a beer. He walked home, which is upstairs at the station, where he sleeps until three after the patrol. He would like that to be in the paper too, as an example.',

  body:[
   'Jack Reed came to the island as a merchant seaman out of Seattle, paid off here in the seventies and never signed on again. The town calls him the harbour master, and the title stuck to the man rather than the job. He checks the tide board before the radio forecast and his knees before either. The harbour office desk holds the manifests, the freight book and the berth radio, on which Ryo, the ferry’s chief officer, gives him distance off at every call.',
   'When the Minato Maru calls he walks to the bitts himself and takes her lines, bow and stern, the way the old linesman did before he went to the bridge. At noon Mrs Sato arrives with two bowls in her aluminium delivery box. She delivers to the harbour only, which he takes as a professional courtesy and never asks about. They are widow and widower; he eats her ramen every day and never says why.',
   'A working harbour teaches patience with tides and with people. When equipment misbehaves he sends for the dock workshop; when a visitor is lost he points them to the right door. Every crate on the cargo quay gets a line in the freight book, and every line gets his initials. He lives behind the screen at the back of the office, likes watching the morning cargo come in, and likes it more when it arrives on time.',

Three hundred yen, swimwear in the bath, please: it is a family bath. In the evenings and at weekends she keeps it, with the marking on her knee and the crossword under the marking.',
   'The bath is her grandmother’s, and so is the opinion that Miss Higa should be married by now. Grandmother Higa says it at breakfast and again over supper. After hours Tetsuo comes to tend the boiler and the pumps. He fixes things; she does the till and pretends not to watch. He takes longer over the pressure gauge than any gauge needs.

She has an opinion about that too.',
