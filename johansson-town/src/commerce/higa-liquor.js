 * liquor too", and the answers that settled it: Higa Liquor closes; Sakura sells all the alcohol over its counter
 * (commerce/konbini.js SAKURA_BOTTLES) and supplies Minato, Sato Ramen and the Coral Bay Bar from its depot
 * (merchandising.js ACCOUNTS.sakura, `alcohol`); Kōji's round becomes Sakura Trading's (commerce/trade-round.js);
 * Grandmother Higa keeps only the bathhouse; the building stands shut, with a notice on the shutter that the drink is at
 * Sakura. Until then (from 21 October) it was open 9–12 and 17–20 round her afternoon at the bandai, Yui minding it on
 * Saturdays.
 *
 * What is left of it is here: the notice, the family kusu still behind the counter, and the yuntaku bench out front.
