 * Why every line in Sakura Shōten is on the floor, who it is for, and why it stands where it
 * does. Nothing in the shop is random: Thuan stocks for the people who actually come in, and
 * lays the floor out the way a 1997 konbini does (docs/SAKURA-SHOP-PLAN.md): the drinks at the
 * back as the magnet, fresh food in the open chiller, one category to a gondola, children's
 * sweets low, the heavy and the everyday nearest the till, impulse at the counter.
 *
 *   zone     where it lives: drinks (the cold cabinet), fresh (the open chiller), pantry,
 *            sweets and daily (the three gondolas), counter (the steamer by the till)
 *   for      the residents who buy it, by name
 *   why      what they want it for
 *   placed   why it stands where it does
 *
 * Tests hold this to the real shelves (sakura-layout.js) and the real cast; the storyteller
 * can use it to know who would plausibly be holding what, and where.

 * Who supplies whom. One wholesaler keeps the town's businesses going:
 *
 *   sakura        Sakura Shōten, Thuan's outright (docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md §3), from its depot in the Quay
 *                 Warehouse (Sakura Trading): the everyday goods — drinks, food, washing, paper goods, batteries —
 *                 and, since Mrs Kinjō retired (§6, addendum 3), the town's flowers and decorations: the season's
 *                 window dressing, festival trimmings, lanterns and wreaths, for the shops, the bar, the bath, the
 *                 school and the town hall. Those are `decor` lines on an account, named goods rather than shelf
 *                 stock: they come in with the depot's deliveries, not off the gondolas. Since 22 October 2026
 *                 (the owner) also the stationery and office supplies Front-Row sold, when Nhung became the island
 *                 doctor: paper, ledgers, pens and envelopes for the town's offices, the school and the police box,
 *                 `stationery` lines on an account, named goods like the decorations. And since Higa Liquor closed
 *                 (the owner, 22 October 2026; commerce/higa-liquor.js), all the alcohol: Sakura sells it over its
 *                 own counter (commerce/konbini.js SAKURA_BOTTLES) and the depot supplies Minato's bottle keep and
 *                 tap, Sato Ramen's bottles, the Coral Bay Bar's ice boxes on Kitano-jima and Mr Fujita's crates,
 *                 `alcohol` lines on those accounts, carried by Sakura Trading's round, Kōji's on his weeks ashore
 *                 (commerce/trade-round.js TRADE_ROUND).
 *
 * Only places that are open trade (src/people/cast.js PLACES): the Fumoto co-op has closed, so Sakura no longer sends
 * it a Wednesday crate; the Rainflower pavilion sells nothing and supplies nobody, and Higa Liquor stands shut.
 *
 * An account is what one business orders from one supplier: owner (who places the order, or
 * contact when it is a post rather than anyone in the cast),
 * lines (what), why (what it is for) and delivery (when and how it arrives). Lines are
 * SHOP_STOCK ids; Sakura's decorations, stationery and alcohol are named goods in their own lists.
