 * Sakura Trading's delivery round (the owner, 22 October 2026: Higa Liquor closes, Sakura sells and supplies all the
 * alcohol, and "Kōji's round becomes Sakura Trading's"). It was Higa Liquor's round since 21 October: Kōji, in his own
 * white kei truck (the Kitahama monthly parking's bay 1), on the days of his weeks ashore that have a drop, between the
 * ice plant and his sleep, paid by the round. Now he loads at Sakura Trading's depot in the Quay Warehouse and Thuan pays
 * him from Sakura's till. His weeks aboard as the bosun's relief (people/ferry-crew.js rotaWeek 1) are not broken: on
 * those, the customers collect, as the `aboard` line of each drop says.
 *
 * Each drop is one of Sakura's trade accounts that takes drink (merchandising.js ACCOUNTS.sakura, `alcohol`): Minato,
 * Sato Ramen, the Coral Bay Bar on Kitano-jima, whose ice boxes go up the ferry's ramp, and Mr Fujita's shed on the west
 * pier: the half-week's crates by his chair and the empties out (world/fujita-day.js). Sakura's own beer comes in with
 * the depot's other goods; the shop is not a drop.
