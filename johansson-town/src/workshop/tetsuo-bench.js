/**
 * Tetsuo's electrical bench in the Dock Electrical & Repair Workshop (compact-shops.js, DOCK_WORKSHOP_ROOM, 8.4 × 7 m).
 *
 * The owner sent a three.js "3D Electrical Workshop Diorama" on 20 October 2026: "This should be used to enhance
 * Tetsuo's workshop". Its ideas, translated to a 1997 Okinawan small-town electrician's shop: a steel-legged bench with a
 * timber top and a raised instrument shelf, a green rubber mat, an analogue oscilloscope, a bench supply with moving-coil
 * meters, a soldering station, a handheld meter, a radio on the mat, a clamp lamp, a pegboard with parts drawers and wire
 * spools, the bench's isolating switch beside the distribution board, an exhaust fan, a floor rack of cable drums and a
 * boat battery, a swivel stool and twin-tube fluorescent fittings. Tetsuo is the town's electrician (electrical
 * maintenance since the consolidation; Chin does the mechanical work at the other bench): ship shore-power jobs, Umi-no-yu's
 * electrics, the town's radios and fans.
 *
 * Every piece is data here first (TETSUO_KIT): what it is, who uses it, why it is there and why it stands where it does,
 * so the room, the tests and the stories ask the same questions. Labels on the kit are Japanese where real kit had them;
 * every prompt and description is English.
 *
 * Editions (edition.js, the owner's ruling of 19 October 2026): on Linux (`machinery`) the bench works: the isolating
 * switch, the lamp, the scope's input, the supply's setting, the iron's heater, the drawer and the fan, with their
 * state in one small object (createBenchState) and a click from the town's own blip. On the web it is a display
 * piece, drawn as Linux draws it at work: the supply on, the scope holding a still trace, the lamp lit, the iron warm, and
 * every prompt reads what the thing is instead of working it.
 *
 * Light: no new lights. The room keeps its one point light and its sky light (compact-shops.js); the lamp shows as an
 * emissive bulb and a pool on the mat (light-pools.js), the tubes and pilot lamps as emissive surfaces. Animation is
 * cheap and runs only while the room is entered (the room's ownedUpdate): the scope and the meter's display are redrawn
 * only when what they show changes (a triggered scope's trace stands still), never more than five times a second.
 */

/**
 * Measured against the town's rooms and New Yokosuka (docs/research/new-yokosuka-lessons.md): its rooms' ceilings are
 * 2.4–3.1 m (ours 2.75 m), its counter and work tops 0.8–0.9 m, its narrowest public lane 0.9 m. A 1990s Japanese steel
 * work bench (作業台) is 1.8 or 2.4 m long, 0.75 m deep and 0.74–0.85 m high; Tetsuo works seated on a stool, so his is
 * the 0.85 m bench with a 0.3 m instrument shelf on posts, the scope's screen at a seated eye height of about 1.2 m.
