/**
 * The two editions of Johansson World, decided in one place (the owner, 19 October 2026: "the web is a gorgeous demo
 * for the Linux game"; AGENTS.md).
 *
 * Linux (steam-deck/, the Electron shell, which sets `window.johanssonDesktop` before the game loads) runs the whole
 * town: every resident's day walked on the navigation grid, their chats and the day's happenings, Sakura's trade and
 * stock, the ship's and the bath's machinery, the live ledgers.
 *
 * The web edition draws exactly what Linux draws (shadows, multisampling, HDR, detail streaming, the Ink grade: the
 * graphics ruling of 19 October stands) and simulates less: what is not seen, or barely seen, is not run. Its numbers
 * are the budgets below; nothing else in the game asks which edition it is.
 *
 * Outside a page (node's tests and tools, even with a stand-in window) there is no web page to be a demo of, so the
 * edition is Linux unless JOHANSSON_EDITION says otherwise: the suites keep exercising the full simulation, and tests/edition.test.mjs
 * checks the web budgets explicitly.
