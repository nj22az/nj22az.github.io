/**
 * The real places the town feed's stories happen in. Each is a room or street in the game,
 * with the backdrop tools/render-feed-backdrops.mjs captures from it (`shot`: a room the
 * audit hook enters, or a street camera), and the nouns a story can pick up there.
 *
 * kind: shop, food, bar, work, bath, civic, outdoor. `regulars` are the residents who belong
 * there, by the live cast's own days (people/cast.js CAST, phase 5 of docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md: every one of the 26
 * is a regular somewhere, the ship's people aboard her, the port clerk at her window, the officer at his station);
 * anyone else is a visitor (nobody the roster retired is a regular anywhere: the storyteller leaves them out of
 * the catalogue too, storyteller.js). tests/feed-storyteller.test.mjs holds the names to the cast. `things` are objects actually in the place, `doing` are
 * verbs phrases that make sense there ("{who} was {doing}"). `activity` is what people do
 * there in a comic: the drinks they may hold (izakaya-serving-visuals.js kinds), how likely
 * they are to (chance) and how likely to be sitting (sit). `captured:false` marks a place whose backdrops have not been
 * photographed yet: it is wired (its regulars, things and shot), but the storyteller does not set a story there until
 * `node tools/render-feed-backdrops.mjs <id>` has run (Chromium with a GPU, or swiftshader given the minutes the first
 * frame takes), and the flag is removed with the pictures committed.
