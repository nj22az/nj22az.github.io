/**
 * Who takes a break on the quay, when, and on which shared spot (world/quay-spots.js; docs/research/new-yokosuka-
 * lessons.md §5, C10). New Yokosuka's harbour workers hand themselves to a "free lunch spot" graph and take the first
 * free leaf, staying 60 to 1,800 seconds; the same here, as a ledger worked out from the town clock alone, so it is the
 * same on every device, after a reload and in a test: every break of the day is laid out in the order they begin, and
 * each takes the first spot of its quay nobody holds at that moment, keeping it until the break ends. A break that finds
 * every spot taken is not taken (they stay at work). A claim covers the walk out as well as the stop, so a spot is never
 * walked to by one while another stands on it.
 *
 * The breakers are the harbour's people when they are ashore: Kōji at lunch between the ice plant and home to sleep (not
 * on his relief week, when he is the ship's bosun), Jack after his ramen and before the afternoon round, Chin straight off the gangway after
 * the motorman signs off and before his supper at Minato, and Kai on Kitano's pier at lunch between calls. Fuji and Ren
 * are signed on from the generators to the shore power with every meal in the mess (ferry-crew.js FERRY_WORKING_DAY), so
 * the ship's day leaves them no time ashore at a shared spot: Fuji's own time ashore is his shed and his chair, Ren's a
 * late bowl at Minato. `notAshore` records that, so a later ship's day with a break ashore can add them here.
