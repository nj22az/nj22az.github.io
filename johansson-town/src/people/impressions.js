/**
 * Impressions: what a resident makes of the mayor, from what he has really done with them.
 *
 * Tomodachi Life's islanders remember who was kind to them, and Animal Crossing's villagers
 * bring up what you did last week (docs/ANIMAL-CROSSING-STUDY.md). Here the memory is the
 * diary's moments (progression/diary.js) of the last fortnight that name the resident:
 * favours he kept, favours he let run late or turned down, presents and drinks. Nothing
 * else counts, so a resident never thanks him for something that did not happen.
 *
 * A favour he turned down or let run late is only known to the one who asked: the friend
 * it was for never heard about it. A kept favour is known to both.
 *
 * The impression is said once, the next time they talk and nothing else comes first (a
 * favour, today's happening), and again only when it changes. Pure: activities.js says it.
