/**
 * Happenings: what makes today not yesterday.
 *
 * A happening is a dated or weekly moment in the town's 1997: the Sunday fish auction, the
 * Haarii boat races, the last night of Obon with eisa drummers in the street. Like the
 * events of a summer-holiday game, a happening does not need any new behaviour: it puts
 * the people it names somewhere for a while (residentPlan reads `happeningPlan` before
 * anything else) and gives them something to say that day (`happeningLine`).
 *
 *   id       stable name, used to remember a line was heard
 *   title    what the town calls it, for notices and the diary to come
 *   on       when: {date:'MM-DD'}, {dates:[...]}, {weekday:0–6} (0 is Sunday), {weekdays:[...]}
 *   hours    [from, to) in minutes of the day, while the cast is placed
 *   dry      called off in the rain (outdoor things)
 *   cast     name -> {place, target, activity}, or a function (profile) -> that
 *   lines    name -> what they say about it, all that day
 *   news     {held, off}: the evening news (and the diary): how it went, and for a dry one how the rain called it
 *            off. Written for each, because "New Year’s Day was called off" is not news, and about what the town
 *            shows: the residents and where they are (boats, festival bamboo, drums and the rope are not built yet,
 *            briefs/NEXT.md section 8).
 *   name     the happening in running text, when the title does not read in a sentence ("Tomorrow: …")
 *
 * The lunar dates (Haarii, Obon, the old New Year) are 1997's: the lunar calendar moves
 * every year, and the town lives in that one.
