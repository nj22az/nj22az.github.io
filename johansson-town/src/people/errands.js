/**
 * Errands: a resident asks Johansson to do something for them, and a small story
 * happens whichever way it goes.
 *
 * Learned from the Animal Crossing games (docs/ANIMAL-CROSSING-STUDY.md): every request
 * a villager makes runs through the same steps, each with its own lines for every
 * personality: the ask, yes or no, a check-in while it is under way, the hand-over, the
 * thank-you, and the ways it can go wrong (too late, pockets full, given to the wrong
 * person). Because the steps are shared, one new kind of errand is a handful of lines,
 * and each ending is a story the town can tell afterwards (the `moment` of each step).
 *
 * The kinds are the town's own, and each says why someone would ask:
 *   deliver  take something of theirs to a friend they cannot visit today
 *   fetch    buy them something from the shop that sells it, because they are working
 *   return   get back a thing they lent, because asking themselves is awkward
 * An errand lasts until the end of the town day it was asked on.
 *
 * Pure: the state is a plain object kept in the save; steps return the line to say
 * (marked up for dialogue/markup.js) and the moment to record.
