/**
 * What the neighbours say to each other when the town's language model is not running
 * (town-mind.js): small talk written to their temperaments.
 *
 * A temperament is two of the four personality dials (personality.js): lively or calm
 * feelings, easygoing or serious outlook.
 *
 *   sunny     lively and easygoing: exclamation marks, delighted by everything
 *   dramatic  lively and serious: every small thing is an epic
 *   easy      calm and easygoing: unbothered, warm, a little lazy
 *   dry       calm and serious: deadpan, exact, quietly funny
 *
 * Each topic says one thing four ways (`open`), answers it four ways (`reply`) and has
 * the first speaker come back four ways (`close`). Every reply must work after any of
 * that topic's openers, and every comeback after any reply, so any two people make a
 * conversation that sounds like the two of them. `{b}` is the other person's name.
 * October 1997, an Okinawan harbour town.
