/**
 * Stand points in a resident's day (docs/research/new-yokosuka-lessons.md §2.3, §6, C6; approved by the owner on
 * 19 October 2026). A phase of a resident's day (cast.js `day`) may name a stand sequence (`{stand:'id'}`, the row's
 * fourth element): instead of one target for the whole phase, the resident walks the sequence's points in order, faces
 * each point's way, waits there doing its activity (a pose of the town's own, a tool in hand where the avatar has one),
 * and moves on, looping while the phase lasts. The points and their reasons are data (stand-sequences.js).
 *
 * Nothing here is random: where a resident is in the sequence is a pure function of the town clock and their name. The
 * walk between two points is timed at New Yokosuka's measured walk (1.25 m/s, §6) along the straight line with an
 * allowance for corners and turning; each wait is drawn from the point's range by a hash of the day, the loop and the
 * point, so the same day plays the same way on every device and after every reload. A walker slower than the timing
 * only eats into the next wait; nobody is ever moved without walking.
