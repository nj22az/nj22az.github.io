 * Where the shops of 21 October 2026 put the residents (the owner's decision: no new people; commerce/coin-laundry.js,

 * commerce/trade-round.js), on the bench outside the shut Higa Liquor of an evening, and at the coin laundry's machines
 * on their washing day. A pure function of the clock, read by the canonical day (canonical-day.js) and the walking
 * residents' planner (social.js residentPlan) before their ordinary rows, so the street, the stories and the tests ask
 * the same question.
 *
 * The world positions are the shops' own (coin-laundry-dressing.js LAUNDRY_PLACES and LAUNDRY_BENCH), written here as
 * numbers so the people modules do not load the buildings; tests/shop-days.test.mjs holds the two the same.
