/**
 * What the residents own and keep: one small thing each that they carry or keep close, so a
 * story can lose it, find it, lend it or ask where it came from. Nothing is random: every thing
 * has a reason in the resident's life, and wherever possible it is the thing their own guide
 * entry already mentions (canon). Where it came from is real too: one of the town's suppliers
 * (merchandising.js SUPPLIERS), the resident's workplace, a family, or another resident.
 *
 *   what    the thing, written to follow "my" and "the" ("bait box", not "a bait box"); one
 *           thing, so a story can say "it"
 *   tale    one short line about it (60 characters at most, so a comic caption stays small and
 *           clear of faces) that a story can narrate as it stands
 *   from    a SUPPLIERS id, 'work' (issued by their workplace), 'own' (brought or made by them),
 *           'family' (handed down), 'won', or the name of the resident who gave or made it
 *   keeps   where it lives when it is not in their hand, as a place phrase ("in his jacket pocket")
 *   canon   true when the resident's guide entry (guide/residents.json) names the thing itself
 *
 * Tests hold every resident to at least one thing and every source to a real one; the
 * storyteller's "lost" stories lose these.
