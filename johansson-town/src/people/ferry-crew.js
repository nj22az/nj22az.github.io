/**
 * The eight posts of the game's manning plan (world/ferry-ship.js FERRY_MANNING) and who holds each: the holders are the
 * consolidated roster's (people/roster.js SHIP_POSTS, docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md §9), resolved to the name the live cast
 * uses today (cast.js liveNameFor), so a display-name change in cast.js never changes who is signed on. Nobody is
 * invented for a post and no post has an anonymous body: the five who were job roles are people (Ryo, Ren, Aya, Jun,
 * Kai), with cabins aboard and, for Kai, the Shiroma house.
 *
 * Her working day (FERRY_WORKING_DAY). The ship is in service from the generators at 06:10 to the shore power at 22:15
 * (FERRY_DAY), and she sails on request within it, so the crew keep one long day aboard, the way a small island ferry's
 * crew does: all eight signed on from 06:05, every station manned when she moves, rest and meals alongside between
 * sailings (the `waiting` watch below), everyone off at 22:20 once the log is written. The bosun's week on and week off
 * (Kōji's relief weeks) and the relief engineer's cover for the chief (ferry-crew-aboard.js) are the only reliefs the
 * roster has, so a day off for the rest is not modelled; nobody holds two stations at once. The master is sober for the
 * whole of it: Fujita's shed, the set and the beer begin after he signs off (world/fujita-day.js reads this constant).
