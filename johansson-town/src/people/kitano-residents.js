 * cannot walk there from Minato: in town they are ferry commuters, away "at home on Kitano-jima" between the boats.
 * Thuan is Johansson's wife and lives with him at kitano-1 and nowhere else (docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md addendum 4,
 * phase 3): the 08:30 boat in, the 22:00 boat home, and the weekend on the island while Nhung keeps the shop.
