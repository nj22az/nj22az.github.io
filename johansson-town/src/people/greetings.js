/**
 * The first thing a resident says when Johansson walks up: chosen for the moment.
 *
 * Learned from the Animal Crossing games (docs/ANIMAL-CROSSING-STUDY.md): every
 * personality has its own greeting for each situation (the first meeting, not having
 * seen you for a week or a month, rain, snow, being indoors, a bad mood, their
 * birthday), and the most specific situation that is true wins. A greeting that notices
 * the moment ("you're soaked!", "where have you been?") makes a resident feel alive
 * before the conversation has started, and it costs one line.
 *
 * The situations here are the town's: Okinawa has typhoons, not snow. There is no "first
 * meeting": Johansson has lived here since 1979 and everybody knows him. The birthday
 * line is only used when a resident has a real birthday (pass `theirBirthday` for those). The lines are
 * written for the four temperaments (people/chat-lines.js) and use the cues of
 * dialogue/markup.js, so each one has its own timing and face.
 *
 * Pure: the caller says what is true now; this says which line, and why.
