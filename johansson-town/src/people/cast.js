/**
 * The cast: everybody who lives on the island, in one list (docs/CAST-PLAN.md).
 *
 * The creator (2026-10-13): "everyone who exists on the island needs a reason to be there", and (2026-10-14)
 * "consolidate and remove unused characters instead make every character have a purpose ... shops that have only a
 * still character is not purposeful". So a person is here only if all four hold, and tests/cast.test.mjs checks them:
 *   1. a home that stands in the world (`home`, a registry id in island-households.js);
 *   2. a purpose the town needs (`purpose`, at `work`); children go to school;
 *   3. a day that takes them through the town (`day`: home, work, a meal or leisure, home);
 *   4. at least three people they love, like, tease or can't stand (RELATIONSHIPS), one of them with some tension.
 *
 * `was` names the figures in the world that become this person (Mrs Higa and Yonamine-sensei become Miss Higa).
 * `alsoAt` is a second home: only duty berths aboard now (Johansson's cabin, Mac's berth), since Thuan's weekday room
 * was dropped (phase 3, addendum 4). Ages are numbers; Johansson, the player, has none.
 * The registry (island-households.js) builds its households from this list; the rest of the code moves over batch by
 * batch (the plan's section 6), and the test names who is still to follow.
 *
 * The consolidation (docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md, roster.js) is switching this list over phase by phase. Phase 2 (the
 * ship): the five supporting crew are people here, with the ship's cabins and Kai's rented house as their homes
 * (`supporting`, so the registry counts them as quarters, not households); Mr Fujita is the master, Chin the
 * motorman, Mac the relief engineer. Phase 3 (the households): Nhung lives at 3 Kitahama with Kōji and Riku; Thuan
 * lives on Kitano-jima only and commutes by the ferry; Kitahama Heights is two ground-floor houses, Mac's and
 * Ms Ganaha's; Thuan owns Sakura outright, which now keeps shop hours; Sakura supplies the flowers and the Port
 * Terminal the post. Phase 4 (the retirements): the ten retired identities of roster.js RETIRED (the Bus driver,
 * Mr Higa Jr, Grandmother Sakurai, Grandmother Chinen, Postman Tōma, Mr Shimabukuro, Mr Ōshiro, Mrs Kinjō, Barfly
 * and Reiko) are no longer in this list, so they have no body, no household, no shift and no nameplate anywhere
 * (castMember returns null for them, and the save migration drops their records); what each did went where the
 * roster says (RETIRED[].transfer): Kōji fishes on his own and Chin mends the boats, Tetsuo keeps the island's
 * electrics, Nhung prints the town's small paper beside the bookshop, the regulars at Minato are the residents
 * themselves. Dr Kakazu retired on 22 October 2026 (the owner): Nhung is the island doctor in his place, and prints the
 * paper in the evenings; Front-Row's books and stationery are Sakura's. Only compatible history stays (Tetsuo's mother was a Chinen; Mr Fujita keeps the old seamen's
 * stories). Phase 5 (the stories and directories): the guide, the feed's places and the Studio tools list exactly this
 * cast; the short display names of the brief (Fuji, Jack, Nao, Koji, Mika, Yui, Tetsu, Aki, Emi, Nils) are the
 * roster's and resolve through castMember, while this list keeps the names the world, its saves and its drawings use.
