/**
 * The stand sequences of the residents' days (stand-points.js; New Yokosuka's measured routines, docs/research/
 * new-yokosuka-lessons.md §2.3, §3.2, §6, C6). Each sequence is a list of points walked in order and looped while the
 * phase that names it lasts (cast.js `day`, a row's `{stand:'id'}`). A point is where the resident stands (`x`, `z`, in
 * the sequence's `frame`: 'world' for the street and the quay, or a room's own frame), the way they face (`facing`, a
 * direction [dx, dz]), how long they stay (`wait`, seconds, drawn from the range by the seeded clock), what they do
 * there (`activity`, and `pose`, one of the town's poses, with `tool` in the right hand where the avatar has one:
 * avatars/tools.js), and why the point is where it is (`why`). Nothing is placed for its own sake.
 *
 * The numbers follow the measured days: a shopkeeper holds two or three stand points with waits of two to twenty
 * minutes (§3.2: 120–1,200 s), a homemaker's day is seven to twelve such rows (§2.3), waits have a median of five
 * minutes (§6: p10 120 s, p90 1,200 s), and people walk at 1.25 m/s between them.
 *
 * Coordinates were measured against the rooms' and the town's own colliders (tests/stand-points.test.mjs proves each
 * point reachable, clear of every solid at the town's contact distance and out of every doorway's opening).
