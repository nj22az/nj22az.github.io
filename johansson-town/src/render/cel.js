/**
 * Cel shading, applied to a town that was not built for it.
 *
 * Sakura Crossing (Kenton-GMI, MIT) gets its hand-painted look by building every
 * object out of MeshToonMaterial from the start. Johansson Town has a hundred and
 * twenty-odd MeshStandardMaterial call sites across fifty files, and districts that
 * stream in long after the first frame — so the conversion happens here instead, as
 * a pass over the scene graph. Anything that arrives later is converted when it
 * arrives, and nothing in src/world/ has to know about any of it.
 *
 * Two things carry the look. A quantised ramp steps direct sun into flat bands, and
 * a patch to the toon BRDF tints the darker bands toward a cool violet instead of
 * just darkening the base colour. That hue shift in shadow is the difference between
 * "anime cel" and "low-poly 3D": an anime background has coloured shadows, not dark
 * ones.
