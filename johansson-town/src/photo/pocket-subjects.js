 * Who and where a pocket photo shows, decided when the shutter goes (src/photo/pocket-viewfinder.js). The camera keeps
 * only the middle of the view, cropped to its 128x112 frame, so a person is in the photo when:
 *   - they are in front of the lens and no further than FAR,
 *   - their head is inside that cropped frame,
 *   - they stand at least MIN_HEIGHT of the frame's height tall (a speck in the distance is not a portrait), and
 *   - nothing solid stands between the lens and their head (`blocked`, the game's own sight test).
 * The biggest come first, at most MAX_PEOPLE. The place is the room when inside; outdoors, the nearest named place
 * (a shop's door, a landmark, a named spot) within PLACE_NEAR, ahead of the lens unless very close. A place says how
 * the words meet it (`at`: "on the main shopping street", "at Sato Ramen"); without one it is "at" its name.
