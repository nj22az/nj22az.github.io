/**
 * The bench round the back of Sakura Shōten.
 *
 * Thuan opens at nine and closes at eight, alone, and until now the only thing she
 * could do between customers was stand. This is where she goes on her break: the
 * gravel yard behind the shop, out of sight of the pavement, with the back wall at her
 * shoulder and nothing to look at but the yard wall and a strip of sky. It is not
 * comfortable and it is not meant to be — she will have a house later. For now it is
 * somewhere to sit down and close her eyes for twenty minutes.
 *
 * The shop's footprint is 14.26 by 11.0 turned a quarter, so its back wall stands at
 * x -18.45 and the west yard runs on to -24.6. Keep space between the bench and
 * the wall fittings, with its back towards the shop and its seat facing the yard.
 *
 * It used to stand further down the wall with nothing but gravel leading to it, so the
 * only way to find it was to walk round the shop on the chance there was something
 * there. STAFF_YARD_ROUTE is the path that now goes to it: off the pavement at the
 * shop's north corner, down the back, and it stops at the bench. A dead end with one
 * thing at the end of it, which is what the back of a shop looks like.
