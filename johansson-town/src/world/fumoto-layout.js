/**
 * Fumoto ("the foot of the mountain"), the farming hamlet at the south-west foot of
 * Mount Aoba: an Okinawan buraku as it stood from the seventies to the nineties.
 *
 *  - Houses in walled yards, every one facing south (+z, towards the sun and the cane),
 *    on lanes of white coral sand. Red tile and coral stone for the old families, concrete
 *    and block for the ones who rebuilt after a typhoon.
 *  - The main lane comes up from the coastal road through the gap between the two south
 *    cane fields, through the hamlet, and joins the summit path below Aoba Radio, so the
 *    hamlet is on the way up the mountain.
 *  - The asagi square (the village's open ground) under an old gajumaru, with the
 *    village well (mura-gā) and the stone bench where everybody sits in the evening.
 *  - The kyōdō baiten, the co-operative store the hamlet owns together: everyday goods,
 *    the telephone, the post box, and the notices.
 *
 * The ground here is the island's own, flattened round the hamlet (island-plan.js), at
 * the same level as Kitahama. The houses are the town's standard walled plots
 * (okinawa/quarters.js walledHouse); who lives in them is people/island-households.js.
 *
 * A plot's `gate:'north'` is the code's name for a gate on the plot's +z side (the frame
 * walledHouse builds in); on the island +z is south, and these gates look south.
