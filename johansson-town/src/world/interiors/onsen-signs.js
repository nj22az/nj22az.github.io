/**
 * Umi-no-yu's printed Japanese: every sign, curtain and caption that is part of the
 * scenery, with what it says in English, where it hangs and why it reads the way it does.
 *
 * The words live here, in one place, so a reader of Japanese can check them at a glance
 * (and the tests can), and so the game, the storyteller and the film letter them the same
 * way. This file is scenery for scripts/english-inventory.mjs: the controls and the
 * narration stay English, the bathhouse speaks Japanese, as a 1990s Okinawan bath would.
 *
 * Period: everything here could have been painted, printed or broadcast between 1985 and
 * 1999. Nothing is a real company's name or mark.
