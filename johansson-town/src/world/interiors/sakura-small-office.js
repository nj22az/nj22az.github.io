/**
 * Sakura's small office beside the till: the room behind the counter's back aisle, through the panelled door at
 * x 5.14..6.28 on z -1.17 (sakura-life.js OFFICE_DOOR), inside walls x 4.66..6.82, z -3.95..-1.21 (sakura-shell.js),
 * 2.16 × 2.74 m, about 6 m² (3½ jō) under the shop's 2.98 m ceiling and its own tube (sakura-shell.js buildTubes).
 *
 * The owner, 20 October 2026, with a three.js "Sakura Shōten - 3D Anime Office" page: "This could probably fix the tiny
 * office next to the till in Sakura." Its ideas are rebuilt here in the town's own way (plain geometry, the cel pass,
 * one canvas for everything printed) and in its canon: Thuan owns the shop and keeps the counter Monday to Friday,
 * Nhung on Sunday, 9:00–20:30, shut on Saturday (commerce/sakura-rota.js); the upstairs is the main office (sakura-office-room.js),
 * and this room is the one at hand during a shift, a step from the till, where the day's sales book is written up.
 *
 * Everything in it is data first: what it is, whose it is, why it is there and why it stands where it does, its period
 * and the Japanese label the real thing carried (`jp`); every prompt and line the player reads is English.
 *
 * Sizes: New Yokosuka's home and konbini (docs/research/new-yokosuka-lessons.md) give the chair's 0.42 m seat, the
 * 0.26 m wall clock, one wall switch per room by its door and, for scale, its 0.80 × 0.40 m living-room TV and
 * 0.83 × 1.88 m kitchen fridge, which a 6 m² back office cannot take: here they are the small kinds a shop office had,
 * a 14-inch portable on a one-door 75-litre fridge. The desk is the upstairs office's steel desk shortened to the
 * 1000 × 700 mm single-pedestal size (片袖机) so the door's swing stays clear.
 *
 * Editions (edition.js): on Linux (`machinery`) the lamp switches, the fridge door opens, the TV changes channel and
 * the chair swivels; on the web each is a display piece whose prompt reads what it is. The sales ledger opens the same
 * way on both (activities.js shopLedger): the live shop's books on Linux, the web's fixed October 1997 paperwork
 * (commerce/paperwork.js) there.
