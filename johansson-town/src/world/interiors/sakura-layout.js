 * gondola gone the worst of them has 0.49m to the nearest fitting: the cold cabinets
 * and the bun warmer, which she reaches across rather than walks between. The gondola
 * itself gives her 0.55m.
 *
 * Her own width used to be stuck at 0.32 because the navigation raster was rasterised
 * at 0.32 no matter how wide the walker was, so anything broader was routed down gaps
 * it could not fit and gave up against its own collision check. The raster now takes
 * the walker's radius (see navmesh.js), so what is left to hold her back is the 0.49m

 * from the front of the shop.

 * the run that lay behind it, kept back rather than dropped: the shop is twice the size
 * of a real konbini and the west end of the floor was bare without it.
