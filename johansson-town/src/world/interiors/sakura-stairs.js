 * Sakura's inside stair is a passage, not a place to walk (the owner, 20 October 2026, on his iPhone: "I don't want the
 * stairs to be traversable it's too much errors when running up the stairs, I want the stairs to lead up to a black hole
 * and we disappear into there and when it loads we come up on the upper floor").
 *
 * So the shop and its office are two rooms. In the shop (the market room) the lower flight rises from the stockroom for
 * five treads and goes into darkness: everything of the stairwell beyond them is black, solid to the walk and to the lens.
 * Stepping onto the first tread (or "Go upstairs") walks him up into the dark while the picture fades to black, and the
 * office storey opens as its own room (interiors/sakura-office-room.js), the shop not loaded at all, with him at the stair
 * head in the hall facing up it. Coming down is the same from the stair head: four treads going down into the dark, and
 * he arrives at the stair's foot in the stockroom. game.js runs the walk, the fade and the change of room
 * (takeSakuraStair); this module is what is drawn at each end and where it starts, ends and arrives.
 *
 * The frames: the shop's (x along the frontage, z from the back room's wall to the window, y up from the shop floor) and
 * the office's (the same x, z from its back wall, y up from the office floor): z_office = z_shop - officeZ.

 * for a reason a builder would give:
 * - strings: a closed string each side of each flight, the treads housed in it, so no step end shows;
 * - the handrail: one continuous wall rail, a 40 mm tube on brackets 65 mm off the wall, 850 mm over the nosing line, from
 *   the foot round the landing to the top (a stair must have one; staff carry stock up it);
 * - skirting where the landings meet the walls (mops and boots); non-slip nosing on every tread (stock in both hands);
 * - the shop's campaign poster (Pixar Thuan, the one on Blue Coral's wall, SP-NK-001), pinned up twice where the climb
 *   sees it: on the wall between the flights at eye height, and straight ahead on the landing (the owner, 27 October 2026:
 *   "bring the posters from the town with the Pixar Thuan into the staircase ... on the walls"). The under-stair cupboard
 *   door that rev A put on that wall is gone ("Why is there a door in the staircase?"): it opened onto the 450 mm well
 *   between the flights, where nobody could reach it;
 * - 1F and 2F plates where each floor starts; the stair light and a switch at
 *   each end, so it can be lit from either; the fire alarm on the landing, the office's way out (evacuateSakuraOffice).
