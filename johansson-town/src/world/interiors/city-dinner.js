 'Thuan points out the ferry terminal far down at Tomari, lit up like a cake. “Ours is the small one,” she says. “It always looks smaller from up here.”',
 'She tells you about her grandmother’s stall in Nam Phước, by the market on the river, in four sentences; the last one is that Sakura Shōten smells like it after rain. You tell her about the boathouse in Sweden and the winters with no sun at all. “No,” she says. “Nobody lives like that.”',
 '“If you were not the mayor, what would you be?” You say a ferry captain. She says she would be the one selling the tickets, so she could tell you when you were late.',
 'You talk about the town: the power house’s second engine, Kōji’s tuna, whether the gateball team will beat Kitano-jima this year. She has an opinion about every one of them and most of them are right.',
 'She asks why you stayed in 1979. You start to say it was the job, and then you tell her the truth: you got off the ferry, somebody gave you a cold barley tea, and you did not want to get back on.',
 'The pianist plays “Hana” and half the restaurant goes quiet. Thuan hums the second verse. When it finishes she looks out of the window for a while and does not say anything, and that is fine too.',
