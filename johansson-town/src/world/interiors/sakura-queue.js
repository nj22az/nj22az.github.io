/**
 * Sakura's till queue (docs/research/new-yokosuka-lessons.md §3.1, C1; approved by the owner on 19 October 2026).
 *
 * New Yokosuka's konbini, measured: the clerk's stand point 0.75 m behind the counter's front, facing the floor; every
 * caller uses the same two queue spots, 1.0 m apart in the entrance lane, facing the till, and a browsing spot on the
 * floor when both are taken. Sakura is three times that shop (it is the town's supplier too), so it keeps its floor
 * and takes the queue: the paying spot at the till and the next spot one metre back along the lane from the door, each
 * with its facing; one browsing spot in each aisle, clear of every shelf's own stand point, for a customer who finds
 * both queue spots taken and tries again when one comes free. Nobody stands in the door's opening (DOOR_PATH): the
 * spots are all clear of it, and the queue never reaches back to it.
 *
 * The shop's own frame (sakura-layout.js): the front door at z 3.91 on x 0, the counter along the east wall from
 * x 4.54 (its customer face) to 5.06, the till at z 0.85–1.17.
