/**
 * Umi-no-yu's electrics: the bath's contract breaker (契約ブレーカー) and the 分電盤 (distribution board) beside it on the
 * wall behind Mrs Higa's stool at the bandai, the circuits the board feeds, and the things on them.
 *
 * Okinawa is 100 V. Every branch is a 20 A breaker on 1.6 mm cable, so a branch carries at most 2 000 W, and since the
 * rewiring (ONSEN_REWIRING) each of the women's three mirrors has a branch of its own: the left mirror and the massage
 * chair's 1994 spur on circuit 1 (14 A at most), the middle and right mirrors on circuits 7 and 8 (12 A each). No branch
 * can be overloaded by what is plugged into it. What the house cannot do is run everything at once: the whole bath is
 * contracted at 40 A (ONSEN_CONTRACT), and the contract breaker sees every branch added up.
 *
 * The busy evening ("Fujita's Back"): the house idles at 9.46 A (the lamps, the andon, the television, the fan, the comb
 * sterilizer, the milk cooler and the pump: 946 W). Three women dry their hair (3 x 1 200 W, 36 A) while Mrs Higa's pot
 * boils at the bandai (1 300 W, 13 A): 58.46 A, 1.46 times the contract. The breaker is thermal, so it does not open at once:
 * it warms. Fujita crab-walks the length of the lobby and feeds the chair a coin (200 W, 2 A): 60.46 A, 1.51 times the
 * contract, and four or five minutes after the dryers and the pot came on (BREAKER_CURVE) it lets go: the whole house goes
 * dark, every lamp, the television, the pump. The board's 60 A main never sees more than 60.46 A (under 105 % of it), so it
 * holds: the contract breaker is the one that trips (ブレーカーが落ちた). Mrs Higa first puts it straight back up with
 * everything still on, and the breaker, still hot, lets go again in about a second (the 'retrip' moment, BREAKER_COOL);
 * then the dryers, the chair and her pot go off and she puts it up again, and it holds (ONSEN_RESET): that order is the lesson.
 *
 * History, kept because the room still shows it: when the board was rewired in 1987 it had six circuits and two spare
 * ways (予備), and all three mirrors' sockets were on circuit 1. In 1994 the new massage chair's socket was run as a spur
 * off the left mirror's socket in white raceway (ONSEN_RACEWAY) instead of from the board, so three dryers and the chair
 * could put 38 A on circuit 1's 20 A breaker, and on busy evenings it tripped. Tetsuo, the island's electrician, fitted two
 * new breakers in the spare ways and gave the middle and right mirrors a circuit each, labelling them on masking tape
 * (ONSEN_REWIRING); the tape is still there. That single-branch overload is history: the board now holds whatever the
 * mirrors do, and the house's limit is the contract.
 *
 * Everything here is data first (ONSEN_CIRCUITS, ONSEN_CONTRACT, ONSEN_SCENARIOS): what each circuit feeds, how much it
 * draws, which lamps and screens go dark without it, and why it is wired the way it is, so stories, the film and the tests
 * ask the same questions the room answers.
 *
 * Loads are switched on and off (switchOn / switchOff): `atRest` is how each one stands when nobody touches it (the lamps,
 * the fridge and the pump run; the dryers, the chair and the pot wait for somebody). A breaker is a thermal switch, so an
 * overload does not open it at once: it warms for as long as its trip curve says (BREAKER_CURVE) and then lets go, which is
 * why everything roars for a while before the CLICK. The film stages the moments it needs by name (stageScenario).
