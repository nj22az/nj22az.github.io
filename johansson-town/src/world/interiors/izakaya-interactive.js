 * The things in Minato you can use.

 * - The pink telephone on its shelf by the door (a 1997 izakaya's own public phone,
 *   ¥10 a call): the harbour office, the ferry desk, Sakura.
 * - The bottle keep: read whose bottles they are, or keep one of your own, which then
 *   stands on the shelf with your name on its tag.
 * - The laserdisc karaoke on its cabinet at the end of the koagari.
 * - The posters and the tanuki, each with something to say.
