/**
 * Nakamura Zenzai, dressed as a 1990s Okinawan shop-house that a family has kept for thirty years (the owner, 21 October
 * 2026: "the ice cream shop looks abhorrent as it is"). The building was a cream box: three blank flanks, an English
 * fascia, an English menu behind the syrups and nothing that said a family lived upstairs. A reinforced-concrete
 * shop-house of the seventies reads by its slab: the floor's edge shows as a band round the walls, every window has a
 * concrete hood (庇) against the rain and the sun, the parapet has a coping, and the services are on the outside: the
 * meters by the street, the gas cylinders and the air conditioner's outdoor unit at the back.
 *
 * Everything here works in the shop-house's own frame (houses.js shopHouse): x along the frontage, +x the stair and the
 * family's door (world +z, towards the drinks machines), z out to the street (+z is Main Street, world -x), y up from the
 * plan's datum; nakamura-plan.js nakamuraPoint turns a point of it into the world. `at` below is that frame.
 *
 * Studied, not copied: the diorama the owner pasted (21 October 2026) suggested most of these; what was left out and
 * why is NAKAMURA_LEFT_OUT. New Yokosuka's Dobuita shop-houses (docs/research/new-yokosuka.md) are the measure for the
 * services on a shop's flank: one meter box by the front at eye height, the conduit up to the eave, crates at the back.
