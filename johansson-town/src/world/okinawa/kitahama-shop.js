/**
 * Johansson Mart, Kitahama (ヨハンソンマート 北浜店): a one-room corner shop at the entrance to Kitahama, kept by
 * Grandmother Higa in the evenings and on Saturdays (the owner, 27 October 2026: "We need a resident we have already, maybe
 * bring grandma higa as the attendant"; "draw the shop in cad and I'll drop a Meshy for you after, exterior and interior").
 *
 * DESIGN DATA, NOT YET BUILT INTO THE WORLD. Drawing KS-001 (docs/qa/kitahama-shop/) is drawn from this; the Meshy
 * models of the exterior and the interior are made to it; the game builds it from this data once they are in.
 *
 * Its own shop, not a copy of any game's or real chain's: by the standing rule that Johansson is this universe's Acme,
 * the chain is a Johansson company and wears the house green of Johansson Marine (johansson-marine.js livery.green).
 *
 * Coordinates: metres. `local` is [u,v,h]: u east and v north from the outside south-west corner of the walls, h up from
 * the apron (the forecourt's concrete). WORLD is where that corner stands on the island (x east, z north, as lots.js).
 * Everything has a `why`: who it is for and why it stands where it does (the repository's "nothing is random").
