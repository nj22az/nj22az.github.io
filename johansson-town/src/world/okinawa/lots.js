 * The lots that were cleared, and what each is now. Phase 4 of docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md cleared the retired residents'
 * houses (brief §8, addendum 3 and 5), and the housing project of 18 October 2026 cleared five Kitahama plots before it.
 * The owner deferred their dressing to the final layout (addendum 2: "the dressing (gardens, 月極 parking, bike sheds,
 * hedges) follows on the final layout"), and this is it: each lot is given to people who already live round it and have a
 * use for it, and that is written beside it (`dressing`), so a story can send somebody there and a test can check that
 * the lot is what it says, that every solid on it has its collider, and that no walking circuit, lane, door approach or
 * opening is in its way (tests/lot-dressing.test.mjs). No house stands on any of them, and no door, light or prompt of
 * the old house is left (tests/housing-consolidation.test.mjs).
 *
 * `ground` is what the lot's ground was when it was cleared: Kitahama's level grass (neighbourhood-ground.js), the
 * quarter's coral sand (quarters.js buildNishiGround), the Front-Row yard's lawn (west-yard.js), the lawn east of Main
 * Street, or Kitano-jima's own ground and plantings (tropical-island.js). The dressing keeps to it: the beds, hedges and
 * cane stand in the grass, the gravel is laid only where cars stand, and the coral sand stays sand.
 *
 * A dressing's `props` are its solids, in world metres, each with what it is and why it stands there; the builder
 * (lot-dressing.js) draws them inside their rectangles and gives each the collider `lot-<id>` of exactly that rectangle
 * and height (the drinks machines carry the quarter's own `vending` collider). `flat` are the surfaces laid on the ground
 * (gravel, paint, a concrete pad: walkable, no collider). `prompts` are what a player can read or look at there, in
 * English; the signs on the lot are in Japanese (`signs`, with what they say).
 *
 * Density and period: the owner's standing reference for what stands where in a small Japanese town is New Yokosuka
 * (docs/research/new-yokosuka.md: its back lanes, 月極 parking, hedges, gardens and harbour yards; study and measure,
 * never copy). Its rooms and streets could not be opened from the cloud session that dressed these lots (the game data
 * is on the project's hosted bucket), so the measures here are the town's own: the bays are a kei truck's 2.6 m with a
 * wheel stop at 5 m, as the police station's bay; a bed is a person's reach across (1.2 m) with a 1–1.4 m path; a hedge
 * is 0.6 m deep and a metre high, inside the lot so the lane's gutter stays. Check them against New Yokosuka's
 * Sakuragaoka and Yamanose lots on the creator's computer.
