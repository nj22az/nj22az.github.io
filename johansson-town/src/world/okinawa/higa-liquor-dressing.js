/**
 * Higa Liquor (比嘉酒店), dressed as the 1990s island liquor shop it is (the owner, 21 October 2026: "I see the liquor
 * store looks abhorrent too … how can we bring them more life and interactivity"). It was a pink box with an open slot
 * in front: a counter a pace inside the pavement, two pots and a wall of bottles, open at midnight. A real 酒屋 of the
 * period is a shop you walk into through aluminium sliding doors under a canvas awning with the goods on its valance:
 * the beer case by the door, the 1.8-litre bottles up the wall, the awamori jars on the floor, the owner behind a
 * wooden counter at the back with the register and the delivery book, the crates of empties stacked outside for the
 * brewery's boat, and in the evening a bench out front where the regulars sit with a bottle (ゆんたく).
 *
 * Shut for good as a liquor shop since 22 October 2026 (the owner: "Sakura sells and supplies all alcohol … and the
 * building stands shut with a notice on it"; commerce/higa-liquor.js). Since 30 October 2026 the room is Kissa Higa
 * (喫茶ひが), Grandmother Higa's morning coffee shop (commerce/kissa-higa.js; briefs/higa-kissaten/): the shutter goes
 * up at ten to seven on weekdays and the doors slide open; the liquor fittings are gone; the counter serves coffee, with
 * a ledge and three stools in front of it, a table for two by the police-station wall and her husband's record player
 * on the Kitano Road wall. The drink stays Sakura's, and the bench out front is still sat on of an evening.
 * The record player, the bentwood chairs and the hand grinder are Meshy models (kissa-higa-props.js, the audit of
 * 30 October 2026 in art/kissaten/meshy/provenance.json); everything else is drawn here, in the kit.
 *
 * The shop-house frame (houses.js shopHouse) is used throughout: x along the frontage (+x towards the police station,
 * world +z), z out to Main Street (+z, world -x), y up from the street. The shop floor is deepened to the back of the
 * building's front half: the old 2.2 m slot becomes a room 5.75 m deep, the back of the ground floor the storeroom with
 * the stock room upstairs (nobody lives over the shop; the Higas live in Nishi-machi).
 *
 * Measured, not copied: New Yokosuka's Dobuita sweets shop (docs/research/new-yokosuka-lessons.md §3.2) is the same size
 * of shop-house, 5.47 × 7.29 m, with a 1.80 × 2.10 m double slider for its door and the shopkeeper's place at the back
 * facing it; Higa Liquor's doors are 1.84 × 2.10 m under a transom, its keeper behind a counter across the back. The
 * konbini there (§3.1) puts what sells first nearest the door, as the cold case is here. Everything drawn is the town's
 * own.
