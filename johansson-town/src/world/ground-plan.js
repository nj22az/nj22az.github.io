/**
 * The ground of a district, as a plan: which class of the rulebook (ground-standard.js) lies where, how high its top is,
 * and what edge stands at every seam. ground-build.js lays it; layout.js asks it where the ground has been lowered (Main
 * Street's carriageway), and the traffic asks it where its wheels go. No THREE here, so the plan can be asked anywhere.
 *
 * The owner, 21 October 2026: "Can you make a plan to finally fix the roads to a unified system? Pavement? Walk paths,
 * grass and sandy beach?" Step 2 of that plan (docs/GROUND-STANDARD.md) moves Main Street and the harbour onto one
 * generator; steps 3 and 4 add their districts' plans here in the same form.
 *
 * A plan is a list of layers in the order they are laid: a later layer takes the ground where it overlaps an earlier
 * one, so a plan reads like the paving gang's drawing (the footway everywhere, then the carriageway cut through it, then
 * the kerbs along it). Each layer is an axis-aligned rectangle with
 *  - `cls`: a ground class of the rulebook, or an edge element (`edge`: kerb, drop, edging, coping) laid between classes;
 *  - `top`: its finished top, a number, a straight grade `{axis, a, ya, b, yb}` (the top runs from ya at a to yb at b
 *    along x or z), or 'flush' for an edge whose top is the surface it is set in;
 *  - `name` and `why`, so the drawing says what it is and the data says why it is there.
 * partitionPlan() cuts the layers into disjoint rectangles, so no two surfaces ever lie one on the other.
