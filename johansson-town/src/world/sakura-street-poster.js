/**
 * Sakura's street poster on another building (drawing SP-NK-001 rev C, docs/qa/sakura-street-poster/). The owner
 * (24 October 2026): "make the ads for Sakura Konbini make a poster we can put on the wall on another building", then
 * "Use another building maybe the ice cream shop".
 *
 * A B1 poster (728 x 1030) of Thuan, pasted to a painted 12 mm board on the south wall of Nakamura / Blue Coral, the
 * ice-cream shop: the plain plaster side that faces down Main Street toward Sakura and the harbour, between its window
 * (x ≈ 10) and the back corner (x 13.4). "After the ice cream, a cold tea." Sakura is a short walk down Main Street
 * toward the harbour from here; NAGI ¥120 is the catalogue's price.
 *
 * The wall's face (z -14.150) and what stands on it are read from the town as the game builds it (raycast and
 * tools/street-poster-audit.mjs); the shop front, its flag and its door are on the other face (the open audit in
 * briefs/HANDOFF-NAKAMURA-EXTERIOR-AUDIT-2026-10-24.md) and are not touched.
 *
 * Earlier revisions, on the Harbour Warehouse: rev A sat behind the Fisheries Co-op's enamel sign; rev B on the north gable
 * faced only the narrow lane. Neither was published.
