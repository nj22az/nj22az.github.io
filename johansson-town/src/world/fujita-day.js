/**
 * Mr Fujita's evening in his shed, as a pure function of the town clock: what is on the
 * set, whether he is laughing at it, and where he is with the beer.
 *
 * He is the Minato Maru's master (docs/CAST-CONSOLIDATION.md §3; people/ferry-crew.js), on the bridge from
 * the generators at ten past six to the shore power at a quarter past ten, sober the whole watch:
 * the set is off and the crate is full until he signs off at twenty past ten
 * (FERRY_WORKING_DAY.signOff, which is FUJITA_DAY.start). The evening is his.
 *
 * The television. He has the remote and no patience: every few minutes he flips to
 * another channel, from what is on at that hour (the night game's last innings and the
 * baseball news, which he keeps coming back to; the late news; the variety shows, the
 * period drama and the cooking; snow after the last station signs off at twenty past
 * eleven). Where he lands is seeded by the day and the minute, so it is the same for
 * everybody who walks past, and testable.
 *
 * The laughing. A variety show gets a laugh out of him every half a minute or so; the
 * ballgame now and then (a home run, a bad call); the news and the drama hardly ever.
 * The more he has had, the easier he laughs.
 *
 * The beer. Umineko lager in the large returnable bottles, from Sakura Trading (see
 * commerce/merchandising.js ACCOUNTS.sakura['fujita-shed']; the Higas' six o'clock van until their shop
 * closed): the round leaves two crates in the shed on Tuesdays and Fridays, and at six every morning he
 * stands last night's empties in the crate by the door, so the floor round his chair is clear when he
 * comes in from the boat. He drinks between
 * three and six bottles an evening (the day decides), from a small glass he fills three
 * times a bottle, pouring with his left hand without getting out of the chair. A glass
 * goes down sip by sip; when it is empty he pours the next; he never puts an empty back
 * in the crate, he stands it on the floor. After the set goes off at a quarter to one he
 * walks aboard Shiosai and sleeps it off, and signs on sober at five past six.
