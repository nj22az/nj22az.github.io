/**
 * Minato Police Station (港警察署), on the lawn corner where Main Street opens into the bus plaza.
 *
 * The owner, 19 October 2026: "the police station should be a real big police station that you can interact with and go
 * inside; the police station could easily grow to the empty lot". His ruling the same day (AGENTS.md, the consolidation's
 * addendum 1): a real station on the empty lot next to the kōban, enterable like the shops, with Officer Mori's
 * accommodation inside it; his home id stays `koban` (the roster and the save migration depend on it).
 *
 * So the station takes both pieces of ground. The building stands on the lot: the empty lawn between Higa Liquor's yard
 * and the old police box, 6.9 m by 8 m, its street face on Main Street's east footway, two storeys of plain Shōwa
 * concrete with a flat roof behind a parapet, as small-town stations were built in the seventies. Where the police box
 * stood is now the station's yard on the bus plaza: the patrol-car bay, the bicycle rack, the flagpole. The old box is
 * gone; its counter window lives on in the station's front wall, under the same 交番 sign, because people still come up
 * to it to ask the way.
 *
 * World metres, +x east (away from Main Street), +z south (away from the harbour). Everything that has to agree (the
 * building, its colliders, the yard's paving, the walk circuit, the interior, the people who live and work here) reads
 * its measurements from here.
