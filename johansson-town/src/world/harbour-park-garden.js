 * What grows in Harbour Park, who keeps it and why: the data the park is planted from (park.js), the guide board reads

 * along the walks, a koi pond with lily pads, the footbath, a big shade tree with its bench and lamp; "nothing random":
 * every bed has a keeper from the cast (src/people/roster.js) and every plant is one an Okinawan park grows, flowering in
 * its own months by the town's calendar (town-clock.js), never all year because it looks nice.
 *
 * The beds are the rulebook's garden earth (ground-standard.js, 25 mm proud of the lawn), laid by the ground generator
 * from ground-plan-coast.js like the walks, each clear of the walks' setts by a strip of lawn, so a bed reads as a bed.
 * No module draws its own soil.
