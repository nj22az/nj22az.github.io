/**
 * The west-shore bank (西海岸護岸): where the island's ground meets the sea north of the Nishi-machi seawall.
 *
 * The Nishi seawall (okinawa/quarters.js) ends at z 29.7, the quarter's ground at 29.3. North of it, to the coast's north-west corner at z 77, the
 * shore used to be a grass slope that ran out under a line of boulders, with the former garden's ground mesh buried
 * under it (garden-layout.js, park-access.js, removed with this bank: 27,000 triangles of which fewer than 300 ever
 * showed, a hump at the seawall's end). What stands there now is a bank a person can see and walk along, finished the
 * way the town finishes its edges on the water (the seawall walk, the quay coping, the east lawn's parapet and chain):
 *
 *   - the neighbourhood's level ground runs out to a coral-stone coping on the coast line, a kerb 10 cm proud of the
 *     grass (neighbourhood-ground.js keeps the ground level to it; the old four-metre grass slope is gone here);
 *   - from the coping the bank is pitched in coral stone down to a strip of sand at the water, the foreshore the waves
 *     wash over, with armour stones settled on it at the toe;
 *   - the drop from the coping to the sand is 0.62 m, more than a step, so the town's chain bollards run along the top
 *     (street-furniture.js CHAIN_RUNS), as they do along the east seawall;
 *   - at the north-west corner the bank turns and runs 2.1 m along the north shore to an end block, so the sea cannot
 *     get behind it; the north shore beyond lies in the lee and keeps its rock.
 *
 * Who walks it: the island's pedestrian circuit (island-plan.js COAST_WALK) comes off the seawall walk at z 30 and runs
 * north along the shore to Kitahama's west link at z 57 and on round the north shore; the grass verge between the walk
 * and the chain is where you stand to look over the reef, and the only place on the west shore where you can.
 *
 * World frame: x east, z north. Distances across the bank (`d`) are measured seaward from the coping's inner edge.
