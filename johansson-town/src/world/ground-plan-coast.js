/**
 * The walks of the east side and the coast, as laid: step 4 of the owner's ground plan (21 October 2026: "Can you make a
 * plan to finally fix the roads to a unified system? Pavement? Walk paths, grass and sandy beach?"; docs/GROUND-STANDARD.md,
 * "Step 4"). ground-paths.js lays them; this module says what lies where and why.
 *
 *  - Harbour Park's walks are the rulebook's park path (rolled crushed stone, 4 cm, flush with the turf at 2 cm), the
 *    stone walks and the pond's circuit alike, in their round joins as the park has always drawn them, and held by a row
 *    of setts wherever they meet the turf (harbour-park-plan.js HARBOUR_PARK_PATHS).
 *  - Umi-no-yu stands on the lawn: no ring of paving round it. A forecourt in front of the bathhouse, from the walks to
 *    its porch, with the footbath on it, is the park's rolled crushed stone, the bathhouse's stepping stones set in it;
 *    the bath behind its fence is the bathhouse's own.
 *  - The walks across the east lawn (the service walk to the town hall's gate, the walk along the park's south edge to
 *    the harbour office) and Kitahama's coastal walk are concrete, flush, edged (ground-walks.js says which and why).
 *  - Kitano Road's footway is concrete at the road's level behind its flush kerb (kitano-link-plan.js), edged on the lawn
 *    side; the carriageway is the rulebook's asphalt behind a 15 cm kerb on the lawn (kitano-link.js).
 *
 * A building's walking circuit is no ring of paving: the walls stand in the lawn, or the sand.
