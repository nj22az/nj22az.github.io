 * The Minato Maru (みなと丸), Minato-chō's town ferry to Kitano-jima, as she is designed: what she
 * is, how she is laid out deck by deck, what drives her, what her switchboard feeds and what she
 * carries to save life (docs/FERRY-AUDIT.md §6; briefs/ferry-audit.md §2–§5).
 *
 * The creator chose the bigger ship and the bigger harbour (2026-10-11): a 199-ton class island car
 * ferry of 34.5 m, the size that worked 15–30 minute crossings in Okinawa in the 1990s, carrying
 * six cars (or an 8-tonne truck and two cars) and a hundred passengers, with a crew of eight.
 * Built in 1994 by Johansson Shipyard on Innoshima in the Seto Inland Sea (hull No. 127); refitted for GMDSS in 1998.
 *
 * Everything is data first, so the model (ferry-model.js, drawn from these numbers since batch 5), the
 * crew's routines (people/ferry-crew.js), stories and tests read the same ship.
 *
 * Frames, as a shipyard draws them: `z` metres forward of the transom (0 at the stern, 34.5 at the
 * stem), `y` metres above the keel (base line), `x` across the ship, + to port. toShip() gives the
 * model's frame (origin amidships at the waterline, +z forward).
