/**
 * Letters: residents write to Johansson, and Johansson can write back.
 *
 * Learned from the Animal Crossing games (docs/ANIMAL-CROSSING-STUDY.md): a resident's
 * letter is put together from three parts written separately for each personality and
 * occasion, the greeting, the body and the P.S. A few of each multiply into many
 * letters that still sound like one person. A letter can carry a present, and the P.S.
 * is where a letter wanders off topic, which is what makes it feel written by hand.
 *
 * Here the parts are written for the town's four temperaments (people/chat-lines.js):
 * sunny, dramatic, easy and dry. Nothing is random:
 *  - the occasion is why the letter was sent (a favour to ask, a thank-you for a present or
 *    for help, a long absence, a typhoon warning), and the town decides when that happened.
 *    Johansson has lived here since 1979 (the photograph in his home): nobody writes to him
 *    as a newcomer;
 *  - the present, when there is one, is the sender's own favourite thing (their tastes
 *    in resident-personalities.js), because people share what they love;
 *  - the P.S. is the sender's own clue when they have one (profiles.json), so a letter
 *    points somewhere real and opens the next story;
 *  - the stationery is the one that sender would choose (STATIONERY.by).
 * Which of the written variants a letter uses is picked by a seed from the sender, the
 * occasion and the day, so the same letter reads the same every time it is opened.
 *
 * Pure data and rules: no DOM. A mailbox in the save holds at most ten letters, as the
 * games' mailbox does; the oldest read letter makes way first.
