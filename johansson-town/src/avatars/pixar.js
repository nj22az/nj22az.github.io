/**
 * Pixar bodies: a resident drawn as the studio's film model instead of the cartoon (the creator, 26 October 2026:
 * "see if you can implement Pixar Thuận into the game"; "Her eyes need to be rigged too"), and then, the same day, "Replace
 * her in the live game and studio now": on every World and Studio page, Thuan is her Pixar body. `?pixar=0` shows the
 * cartoon (to compare); `?pixar=thuan` names the bodies wanted. Everyone else stays the cartoon (AGENTS.md, the owner's
 * workflow of 24 October 2026: main keeps the cartoon until the Pixar world is complete; this resident by his word).
 *
 * The body is made in the studio repo (jojo `3d/cast/game_thuan.py`): her film model posed into World's rest (arms and
 * legs straight down), her weights on World's own bones, her painted eyes painted out, lightened for a phone. Here it is
 * worn by the avatar World builds anyway: the same bones, so every walk, sit, reach and gesture moves her; her card's
 * joints and measures replace the cartoon's (build.js), so feet, seats, hands and braids meet her own body; the cartoon's
 * meshes stay built and hidden. Her face is rigged: her eyes are World's rigged eyes (eyes3d.js) on discs laid over the
 * painted-out place, in her own size (they look about, blink, the lids follow the gaze, the iris lies under the cornea);
 * her brows and mouth are drawn on decals of their own (face-features.js), shaped by every feeling and by talking; her
 * jaw, nose and cheeks are bones that move her skin (the jaw opens with the mouth, the cheeks rise with a smile, the nose
 * scrunches in anger). Not drawn: the cartoon's other outfits (swimwear, the bath towel, the sailor and shopping outfits).
 *
 * Each body acts its feelings its own way (face-acting.js; the creator, 26 October 2026: "Thuans expressions need some work
 * too, she needs more personality when she is shocked and the different expressions, now she comes off as Generic"), and
 * its face gets from one feeling to the next on springs of the feeling's own timing (a shock pops and settles, sadness
 * sinks in). The same day, "Fix Johansson's blockers and bring him into the game": Pixar Johansson (jojo
 * `3d/cast/game_johansson.py`), the player's own body in the third person: clean-shaven and bald, his mouth drawn as hers
 * is, and an older face's lines (face-acting.js `lines`). Both are lit as skin (pixar-skin.js: the creator's rendering
 * brief of 26 October 2026).
