 * Small things the story puts on a body, each with its reason (nothing is random), built light for phones: a handful of
 * plain shapes each, cel-shaded like the room they come from, no textures, and at most one light (only once it is
 * switched on). They are carried by the body's own bones, so they move with it; the moves that use them (animate.js:
 * TorchUp, TorchOff, SitRead, CordWrapped, BasketHead) say where the hands are, and this module places the thing.
 *
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('torch')          Tetsuo's pocket torch, clipped to his shirt (or vest) at the left chest
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('basketOnHead')   a locker basket upside down on the head, resting on the head (or its towel)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('newspaper')      the evening paper, folded, held open between the two mittens while reading
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('paperback')      Miss Higa's novel, open in her right mitten (the film turns it to her facing)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('pumpkinSuit')    a Halloween costume (also 'ghostSheet', 'witchHat'): buildCostume
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('dryerCord')      the vanity dryer's cord, wound round the body and its pinned arms
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('safetyGlasses')  clear safety glasses over his own glasses (WORK_KIT)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('headlamp')       a headlamp on an elastic band round the head, lit, with its own light (WORK_KIT)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('gloves')         electrician's rubber gloves over both mittens, gauntlets over the cuffs (WORK_KIT)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('voltageTester')  a two-pole voltage tester in the right mitten, its second probe parked on it (WORK_KIT)
 *   storyProps(avatar).giveKit('electricianWork')   all four at once: Tetsuo's work kit for a board (WORK_KIT)
 *   storyProps(avatar).give('smartphone')     a smartphone in the right hand, its screen to her (Selfie); .userData.fit() once posed
 *
 * The moves give what they need themselves (SitRead the paper, CordWrapped the cord, BasketHead the basket, TorchUp the
 * torch, at his pocket); giving it beforehand puts it in place before the move (the torch on his pocket in 3f).
