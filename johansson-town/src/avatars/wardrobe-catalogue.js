/**
 * The wardrobe catalogue: one entry for every item anyone can put on in the maker, World's photo studio and Johansson
 * Studio's Edit character -- every wardrobe part in recipe.js PARTS and every set in outfits.js.
 *
 *   {slot, id, label, category, tags, who, why, supplier?, colourways:[{name, colours}], wornIn?}
 *
 * Nothing is random (CLAUDE.md): `who` names the islanders who wear it and `why` says what it is for, and the maker shows
 * both under the pictures ("Worn by … · why"). `label` is the short name under a picture (about 18 letters). `category`
 * files it under one chip of its tab, `tags` are the places and occasions a search finds it by. `colourways` are the
 * real colour variants an item comes in, as recipe fields: an outfit set's fields are outfit fields (topColour), a
 * part's are full paths ('outfit.shoes'); an item that comes in colourways is put on in its first.
 *
 * Labels are per slot, so an id two slots share (`police` is a top and a hat, `none` a hat and an earring) reads right in
 * each. Ids are appended, never renamed: saved looks and share codes hold them.
