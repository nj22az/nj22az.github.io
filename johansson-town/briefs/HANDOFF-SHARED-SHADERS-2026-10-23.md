# Shared illustration shaders — implementation handover

23 October 2026. Branch `codex/shared-illustration-shaders-2026-10-23`. Implementation rebased onto main `03dd675c5e70f166e29f9f87eb30a76a4d4f19f6`, preserving the newly merged Nhung/Higa/controller work. [PR #382](https://github.com/nj22az/nj22az.github.io/pull/382) is open and mergeable, with implementation publishing commit `bae2618fa31514f592a5053ac8dd186ae6f0ae1b` (local implementation `ff657a3b`, integration/runtime/docs `bddb0b3a`). Final check results follow below. Visual changes are not merged or deployed.

## Delivered behaviour

World and Studio use the same fourteen-look GLSL factory with explicit depth/normal capabilities and preview/export sample budgets. Natural remains the comparison baseline. Manga has readable tiered screentones and restrained spot blacks; Cartoon uses scoped two-band 3D materials; Oil uses an orientation-guided anisotropic quadrant Kuwahara filter. Other styles gain monochrome contrast, sepia duotone, fixed 16-colour mapping, feature-preserving Pocket edges, restrained CRT separation, geometry edges with pressure variation, curated woodblock inks, quieter watercolour washes and brighter Crayon paper.

The shared auxiliary renderer captures normal/depth from the same posed scene and camera; alpha-cutout texture transforms are honoured, source materials restored, normal resources disposed, and shadow updates disabled during the auxiliary pass. Opaque RGB24 depth avoids Canvas alpha-rounding loss. Capture happens on explicit scene capture/export, not every animated preview. Standard skinned/morphed/instanced meshes use the same geometry. Custom shader-only vertex deformation has not been separately verified. Object-ID buffers were optional in the plan and are not implemented.

Fresh Studio projects retain validated optional capture PNGs and camera metadata. Miniature supports depth focus and deliberate tilt focus, with editable/persisted distance and range; World exposes the same focus API. Legacy picture-only projects remain editable with honest 2D-approximation notices. Captured plates reconstruct world-space stroke coordinates; live Crayon uses rest-position triplanar strokes. Full Cartoon/Crayon material changes require Edit scene and recapture when starting from an old Natural plate. `baseLook` prevents duplicate filtering of an already baked identical look.

Lettering stays editable after effects, including replacement, translation and assets; deterministic small contour jitter affects bubble/border paths, never glyphs. The original built-in comic layer pack and all fourteen original reference exports were preserved. PR #371 was verified open and documentation-only before implementation; no parallel physical-material overhaul was imported.

## Evidence and acceptance

- 40 focused shader/cel/material/comic checks passed before integration; after rebasing, seven capture/material/runtime checks passed, including current-source runtime fingerprints.
- Comprehensive real WebGL browser test passed before and after integration: numeric depth error below 2e-7, normal orientation, alpha cutouts with texture transforms, source material restoration, two actual World environments across all fourteen looks plus Manga/Cartoon/Oil night cases (34 combinations), camera and pose changes.
- Real MCP stdio + Chromium regression passed. Saved project focus controls including tilt mode round-tripped through the actual Studio UI. All fourteen legacy picture-only looks compiled without shader errors.
- Matched-camera compiled-game checks passed on old and revised builds: street and Community Hall, Manga/Cartoon/Oil/Crayon, 12 steps each, zero errors/fallbacks. Latest-main integrated compiled-game smoke also passed: 12 steps, all eight requested street/interior screenshots, zero errors/fallbacks, 106.4 s total. The comprehensive shared pipeline and runtime checks passed again after integration.
- Pre-integration full guard: 361 passes, one process-level failure in `no-z-fighting.test.mjs`; isolated TAP rerun reports SIGKILL, with cgroup OOM kills observed. This is not a passing full guard. No test weakened or skipped to mask it. Latest-main full rerun was interrupted under the same memory pressure; isolated latest-main retry with a 2 GiB heap conclusively reports JavaScript heap exhaustion (SIGABRT). No full-guard pass is claimed. The guard must run on a better-provisioned runner.
- Runtime rebuilt after latest-main integration (10.24 s); native browser checks use software WebGL. Timings include compilation and are not physical GPU/iPad/iPhone performance acceptance. Device frame-rate targets and owner visual acceptance remain outstanding.

## Review files

Saved separate Manga, Cartoon and Oil full-strip previews, a three-page before/after PDF, and a fresh 6,282,788-byte `.studio.json` project with normals/depth. Locations in this session:

- `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/after-manga.png`
- `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/after-flat.png`
- `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/after-oil.png`
- `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/shared-shader-before-after.pdf`
- `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/captured/make-something.studio.json`

Reproduce with `avatar-creator/render-shader-proof.mjs` (optional `STUDIO_PROOF_OUTPUT`), `STUDIO_BROWSER_TEST=1 node --test avatar-creator/tests/shared-looks.browser.mjs`, and `node johansson-town/tools/shader-world-smoke.mjs <output>` (`--baseline=<git-ref>` for an available retained build). Set `TOWN_CHROMIUM_PATH` when Chromium is outside Playwright's default cache. Do not overwrite the original reference PNGs.

Next: review separate before/after strips, complete the geometry guard on a sufficiently provisioned runner if memory termination persists, measure actual target devices, then merge/deploy only after the planned visual review. Minato remains the priority; no island expansion is part of this work.

Final sign-off: implementation and review files delivered in open, mergeable PR #382; no merge/deployment claimed. `git diff --check` passed. Current runtime entry is `boot-bEI-4URo.js`; source fingerprints match. The incomplete geometry guard and actual-device profiling remain explicitly open.

## Second owner review - 23 October 2026

Owner supplied a second visual critique after the seven-page review PDF. Refined the same shared code on PR #382, preserving the first review files. Corrected one diagnosis: Cartoon already quantised luminance, not individual RGB channels. Removed its saturation expansion and independent channel clipping, limited common gain, and added a restrained cool shadow tint. Natural is untouched.

Manga now outputs pure black/white picture pigment; antialiasing in final composition/downsampling can still soften display edges, but no tinted grey substrate remains under tone dots. Depth-clear canvas backgrounds are thresholded once and bypass tone/edge expansion, so hero rays stay solid. This also leaves clear sky as unprinted white. Existing lettering stays separate.

Oil keeps its orientation-guided clustering; uniform linen modulation drops from .04 to .016 (60 percent) and, with the quieter stroke modulation, appears only where the paint is bright/thin. A capped five-percent derivative ridge catches clustered paint boundaries. This is a graphic impasto cue, not a physical specular material.

Crayon rest-space strokes now have short staggered runs, low-frequency coordinate wobble, 45-degree primary strokes, a crossed shadow tier and cellular wax grain. Grain is shared across both directions per surface projection; bright surfaces bypass stroke work. The saved-picture fallback also breaks its runs and uses light/dark tiers, but is still the documented approximation. `render-shader-proof.mjs` accepts optional `STUDIO_PROOF_LOOKS` to recapture the four complete comic variants through the production editor.

Validation so far: 34 focused/capture/material/runtime checks passed, rebuilt runtime `boot-Cre9fA3O.js`, comprehensive real WebGL test passed all fourteen looks in two environments and the six night combinations. New GPU assertions require strictly binary Manga across a grey ramp and bounded neutral hue drift in Cartoon. Full four-style production comic recaptures completed without page/shader errors and were visually reviewed. Matched-camera full-game screenshots and refreshed review PDF follow below. Previous full-guard memory exhaustion and missing physical-device profiling remain open; this refinement does not claim to resolve those.

Second-review final evidence: compiled-game check passed all 12 steps/eight street and Community Hall screenshots with zero errors/fallbacks in 113.4 s. Reviewed the four fresh full comic recaptures and all eight rendered PDF pages. Delivered `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/refinement-2/johansson-shader-refinements.pdf` (eight pages), four separate comic PNGs and `refined-game-screenshots.zip` (eight PNGs). The three first-review comparisons use their immediately previous versions; Crayon is explicitly labelled against the original fourteen-style reference. Fixed camera positions are the same, but weather/sky lighting can vary between game runs; this is not a lighting-identical benchmark. Existing first-review files are preserved.

Second-review source and runtime are a follow-up to publishing commit `512b3a01f7896de9041ad2d2524a73fb364bafad` on the same PR #382 branch. `git diff --check` and the 34 focused/runtime checks pass. The full geometry guard is still not signed off; no re-run of that memory-heavy guard or device-performance acceptance is claimed for this follow-up.

Second-review publishing commit: `53c9bae47b603e5018fdf885df9ac4fe6e51b2e3` (local `303fb52a`) in PR #382. Review PDF, screenshot ZIP and four individual strip PNGs saved successfully.

## Hybrid illustration review - 23 October 2026

Owner supplied the next review and suggested four hybrid styles. Traced Crayon's white cheek patch to the post-pass pigment coverage fading to paper above .70-.75 luminance, not a demonstrated UV/normal wrap. Replaced that fade in the live surface-stroke path with a continuous chroma-aware wash beneath the strokes. A real WebGL warm-skin fixture checks that the former threshold keeps its pigment; full comic recaptures are being checked below.

The existing Manga code already used circular `length(fract(...)-.5)` dots. Extracted its tone module and inverted the dense tier into circular paper holes, avoiding near-touching black-dot webs. Cartoon's near highlights now use full luminance stepping; lower tones are more deliberate while distant texture still fades continuously. Oil's full export kernel was already wide; its cheaper kernel now reaches a nominal twelve pixels too, and Oil/Gouache bypass the earlier World ink pass. Oil retains coloured detail from the source instead of rebuilding features in artificial black.

Added `src/render/illustration-modules.js`, reusing the existing dot, pencil and orientation-guided Kuwahara stages with shared cel and wash functions. Compile-time recipes create four new selectable look IDs: `storybook` (cel + restrained wet edge + shadow rest-pencil + ink), `sunday` (cel + binary shadow dots + ink), `sketchbook` (warm wash + broken pencil + porous graphite), `gouache` (clustered paint + three-tone colour, no added ink pass). This is a shared modular shader factory rather than an unrestricted mixer UI or a dynamic uber-shader. The original fourteen IDs remain supported; the catalogue now contains eighteen. Storybook/Sunday scope cel ramps and flattening; Storybook's material pencil is confined to shadow tones.

World and Studio consume the same capability flags, recipes and material treatment. Added distinct picker swatches and kept short labels for the phone UI. Editable text and bubbles remain separate; the new ink-bearing presets inherit the existing inked border/bubble contour treatment. Imports are versioned `20261023-hybrids`. The game proof helper accepts `--looks=<comma-separated IDs>`.

Validation so far: 33 focused look/material/picker/capture checks passed, then a dedicated paint-prepass switching test passed (Oil/Gouache off; Cartoon/Natural restored). Nine model/material checks passed. Real WebGL acceptance passed fifty environment/style combinations: all eighteen looks in two environments plus seven night looks in each; legacy hybrid preview/export shaders compiled too. Numeric depth, cutouts, material restoration, binary Manga, neutral cel colour and the new warm-pigment fixture passed. Full-game proof, runtime rebuild and export review follow below. The previously documented geometry-guard memory exhaustion and physical-device acceptance remain open.

Hybrid-review final sign-off: local implementation `c3ff91e8`, publishing implementation `a890d74f5bc31c2ed5a6267d040aebaaa999f229` on the same open PR #382 branch. Current runtime `boot-DzizFcBa.js` was rebuilt in 10.81 s and current-source runtime checks passed. Final focused set: 43 passes, zero failures. Final WebGL test: fifty combinations passed, including preview/export compilation of legacy hybrid plates and the pigment fixture. Real MCP stdio/Chromium acceptance passed in 20.5 s with all eighteen looks discovered and Storybook exported/reopened alongside text/assets/translation regressions. Full compiled-game proof passed sixteen steps and twelve screenshots (six styles in street and Community Hall), zero errors/fallbacks, 146.8 s. All eight complete comic variants were recaptured, with an extra Oil/Gouache feature-preservation pass, and visually reviewed.

Delivered `deliverables/shared-shader-upgrade/hybrid-illustrations/johansson-hybrid-illustrations.pdf`: ten pages, 7,420,228 bytes; all rendered pages reviewed for layout. Also saved `hybrid-game-screenshots.zip` (twelve PNGs), `hybrid-comic-variants.zip` (eight PNG strips), separate new preset/Crayon PNGs and a fresh editable `.studio.json` project. Original review files are preserved. The PDF uses the previous Crayon export for the cheek comparison and previous street Oil for the ink-pass comparison; fixed cameras do not imply identical weather.

After effects applies the picture recipe; full cel material treatment still needs Edit scene and Update panel. The Cartoon/Storybook/Sunday notice now states this even for a plate with captured depth, since geometry buffers alone cannot reconstruct or flatten its original materials. Saved depth still supports geometry-aware picture edges and surface-coordinate strokes. This clarification changes the status notice, not rendered pixels.

No merge or deployment performed. Full geometry guard remains blocked by the previously documented memory exhaustion; no actual-device frame-rate acceptance claimed. Next: owner review of the four prototypes, the cheek comparison and broader paint rendering; retain Minato priority and complete those outstanding checks before rollout.

## Visual recovery after owner rejection - 23 October 2026

This section supersedes the hybrid rollout described above. Owner explicitly rejected Storybook's scratches, Sunday's dirty colour dots and Gouache/lineless Oil losing readable geometry. Remove Storybook, Sunday Strip and Impasto Gouache; do not revive these presets without a new request. Preserve the successful continuous-pigment Crayon cheek fix and the architectural Sketchbook.

Restored Cartoon, Manga and Oil fragment kernels from local `303fb52a` (the second pre-hybrid refinement). Restored the World ink prepass for all active styles and the pre-hybrid Oil kernel/detail treatment. No paint style now disables contour ink. Simplified the shared helper module to only wash/pencil stages used by Sketchbook; removed the discarded recipes, material treatments and picker icons. Catalogue: original fourteen plus Architectural sketchbook, fifteen total. Natural remains unchanged.

Retained Crayon's chroma-aware continuous pigment wash. Added a uniform adapter context (`uComic`: World 0, Studio/After effects 1): comic Crayon uses 20 percent darker graphite and firmer edge coverage; comic Sketchbook gets 25 percent more colour saturation and darker graphite. World Sketchbook retains the approved soft wash and porous line treatment. No new raw-luminance hatch or dot treatment is applied to Cartoon, Manga or Oil.

Retired saved scene/effect IDs migrate to Cartoon (`storybook`/`sunday`) or Oil (`gouache`). A baked retired picture retains its base marker and shows a specific Edit scene/Update panel notice; changing its effect cannot unbake scratches, dots or missing detail. Original scene camera/poses stay editable. Imports are versioned `20261023-recovery`.

Initial validation: 41 focused look/material/picker/capture/scene checks passed. Added regression coverage for retired catalogue entries, effect migration/baked markers and ink enabled across retained styles. Current WebGL, production comic recaptures and game proof are recorded below when complete. Earlier geometry-guard memory failure and lack of physical-device performance acceptance remain open.
