# Ferry-office bench removal — 24 October 2026

## Owner request and cause

The owner again supplied the live scene and asked, “This bench is still there why?” The earlier request was to remove the bench among the flowering shrubs and the projecting beam over the ferry-office door, with removal of the sign suggested tentatively.

The earlier implementation was uploaded as an unreferenced review commit, [`87a93ad8db0d96c0ee1fda6e41da47189929ed9a`](https://github.com/nj22az/nj22az.github.io/commit/87a93ad8db0d96c0ee1fda6e41da47189929ed9a), followed by review handover `c82804fe02e3826c6cec485620cf80ac05198d24`. It never reached a publishing branch. The website still matched `main` `7356f64ad017afa2e38e41403ecbcd3fd83b1e09`: the entry page, boot/game bundles and inspected world modules were downloaded and compared byte for byte. The bench therefore remained in the published game.

The newer [woodland poster request](HANDOFF-WOODLAND-POSTER-2026-10-24.md), published as `afe5ba69526a5c20bc47ab53abfad412aae73159`, gives the harbour notice board an active purpose. This correction preserves that board, its flyer, the Look menu and its 3D viewer. The old review is selectively ported, not merged wholesale.

## Changes

- Remove `sakura-viewing-bench`, centred at `(6.6, -32)`, including its builder, deferred model registration, collider, seating marker and sit action. Other park benches remain.
- Remove the narrow concrete hood over the office door in `src/world/port-building.js`. The door, office sign, windows and ferry waiting canopy remain.
- Retire the Sakura bench opening. Old `?spawn=sakura-bench` links resolve to the existing clear fish-auction standing point at `(19.8, -40)`.
- Recover old Linux checkpoints inside the former rotated bench footprint to that standing point, for both the general checkpoint and per-resident records. Home, room, ship and neighbouring path checkpoints retain their positions.
- Update the existing startup, seat, opening, Linux-life and audit-tool checks/defaults. Keep the notice board’s interactions and the existing runtime stability threshold.
- Rebuild from the current published runtime manifest, retaining its chunks for open pages while publishing new content-hashed entry points and service-worker version.

## Validation

- `npm run build:runtime`: passed. Entry `boot-NaJQUdXp.js`; source fingerprint `71b35d7f78b51e7f166a42ed990b55125a24b8aae2fc672c6fcce9abe4bb82a2`; service-worker version `47d64e919d29c32b59f0`.
- Full local World guard: **400/400 checks across 76 files**, zero failures/skips/todos, 148 seconds (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144 node tools/ci-guard.mjs`). The retired bench’s two old positive tests become one complete removal/preservation check, explaining the previous 401 → current 400 count.
- Additional existing `openings`, `port-building`, `spawn-scene` and Linux `life` test files: **20/20 passed**, zero failures/skips/todos.
- Actual compiled-game review: all six matching before/after photographs captured and visually inspected. Both reports have no page errors and passing runtime stability. The after report confirms no bench/seat/sit prompt, retained board/flyer, a standing legacy opening, and Look opening/closing the woodland viewer successfully.
- Syntax checks, `git diff --check`, and independent source review: passed; no remaining blocker. Review specifically covered the rotated checkpoint footprint, both saved seat slots, per-resident switching, streaming removal and preservation of the newer board.

Exact local verification metadata is in [verification.json](../docs/qa/ferry-office-frontage/verification.json).

The reproducible [before-and-after gallery](../docs/qa/ferry-office-frontage/README.md) uses the real compiled game, with matching portrait, desktop and phone doorway cameras. `tools/ferry-office-frontage-photos.mjs` also checks the deleted objects and seating prompt, safe legacy opening, retained board/flyer, and Look opening and closing the woodland viewer.

## Publication state

Prepared directly from `main` `7356f64ad017afa2e38e41403ecbcd3fd83b1e09`; no additional remote branch or prototype merge. Local verification is complete. Publication and live-file verification are the remaining steps at this commit; their exact results will be recorded in the completion update.

## Limits

Browser checks use software Chromium and emulated viewport sizes. No physical iPhone/iPad/Steam Deck test is claimed. Shared Linux source and save compatibility are updated, but this task does not publish a new Linux installer.
