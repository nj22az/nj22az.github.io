// No flashing surfaces aboard the Minato Maru (the owner, 3 November 2026: "there is lots of z-fighting in the whole
// ferry, have you audited interiors and the bridge"). The town's scan (tests/no-z-fighting.test.mjs) leaves her out: she
// is a dynamic prop, placed by the clock. This scans her as buildFerryModel() builds her, every room, the bridge, the
// casings, the car deck, the ramp and the boards: two faces that look the same way, lie within 2 mm of one plane and
// overlap are drawn at one depth, and the depth buffer picks a different winner from frame to frame. Each piece of a
// merged mesh is named by the line that made it (__KIT_TRACE__), so a finding says where to fix it.
//
// The audit found 72 such pairs (12.2 m²): the lane boards' faces in their bodies' planes, door leaves hooked back
// through fire-hose boxes, the purser's counter and the drink machines standing out over the stair wells, a stair rail
// running up inside the lobby's wall, every wall opening's reveal in its frame's plane, the wings' floor closing over
// the crew stair's well, curtains, the crossing chart's layers, the ramp's hinge pin in its girders' faces, and others.
