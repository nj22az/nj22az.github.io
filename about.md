Nils (Sudesh) Johansson is a seasoned marine engineer turned field service engineer with Swedishâ€“Caribbean heritage. He managed ship engine rooms worldwide before transitioning ashore to commission precision material-testing systems at Instron and gas-turbine systems across Southeast Asia. Passionate about cross-cultural collaboration and fascinated by the blend of ancient traditions and modern innovation in regions like Vietnam, Thailand and Japan, he brings a global perspective to engineering problems and a love of travel and history. This blog combines technical insights with reflections on culture and exploration.
