## Field service engineer in perpetual motion

I keep complex deployments on schedule by translating technical chaos into clear, shareable plans. Marine engineering roots taught me to listen to the machinery first, then speak calmly to the people who depend on it.

## What you will find here

- Dispatches and checklists captured after on-site engagements.
- Culture briefs for teams crossing borders, ports, and work styles.
- Toolkits, downloads, and runbooks meant to scale beyond one job.

## Why I publish the notes

Every engagement improves when information moves faster than the stress. These entries exist so the next crew can see the pressure points before they board and stay aligned when the unexpected hits.

If you are gearing up for a similar deployment, take what you need, remix it, and ship safely.
