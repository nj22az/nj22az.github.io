Singapore is built on punctuality and precision. The workshops mirror the harbourâ€”containers move, cranes swing, and the expectation is that you will match that pace.

## Meetings in motion

Briefings start on time and dive straight into detail. Show the data, acknowledge the plan, and keep detours tight. A follow-up note the same day is appreciated.

## Breaks are for questions

Teh tarik breaks unlock the best context. People share the stories that diagrams cannot capture.

## Walking the docks

Take time to watch the daily choreography. The city teaches you how to think in systems.
