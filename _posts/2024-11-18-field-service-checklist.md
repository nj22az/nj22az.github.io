Before wheels up I run the same ritual: talk to the local team, re-read the fault logs, and make sure every adapter and consumable has a duplicate in the case. This checklist is the compressed version of that ritual.

## The 48-hour brief

Forty-eight hours before departure I confirm power standards, network access, and security contacts. These small conversations prevent the last-minute scramble that derails schedules.

## On-site cadence

Day one is about instrumentation. Quantify the baseline, walk the lines, and map the informal workflows. Only then do the fixes stick.

## Post-engagement wrap

The visit ends when the lessons are packaged. Share the remediation steps, the "watch fors," and the cultural notes with the team that follows.
