We ran a tabletop drill for the next offshore deployment to prove out the communications spine and redundant power links.

## Objectives in focus

1. Validate the packet loss budget end-to-end across the satellite link.
2. Confirm the inspection crew can break down and rebuild the staging rig in under three hours.
3. Verify our remote triage workflow when pressure or heat thresholds drift.

## Artifacts bundled for the team

- **Signal uplink map** — the diagram above highlights the two-hop failover. If the stadium link drops, the relay ship should still see 92% throughput.
- **Deployment run sheet** — the updated checklist is versioned in the shared drive; QR codes are on the new laminated cards.
- **Issue reporting cadence** — we will run fifteen-minute huddles; if you flag an anomaly, capture a voice memo and drop it in the ops thread.

## Notes for the live day

Watch the weather window. If the wind gauge reports anything over 32 knots, we delay the lift. Remember the sat dish can swivel, but the truck does not love those gusts.

The crew lead will publish a red/yellow/green board inside the ops channel the night before wheels up. If you see yellow, assume we'll be on standby — prep kits anyway.
